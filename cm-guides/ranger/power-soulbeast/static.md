- Pet: <Skill id="43636" disableText/> Rock Gazelle.

- Take <Trait id="2143"/>.

- In faster kills you want to run <Item id="82876"/> instead of <Item id="24615"/> on longbow.

- If you don't trust your group to deal DPS in phase 2 then you can take <Trait id="2128"/> and use <Skill name="OneWolfPack"/> when you return to MAMA in phase 2. The reason for this is because in phase 1, 3 and 4 you have the damage modifier from <Effect name="Exposed"/>, so compensating with <Skill name="OneWolfPack"/> can help the team phase MAMA faster here.

- In faster kills you want to run <Item id="82876"/> instead of <Item id="24868"/> on Longbow.

- If you are running with double Soulbeasts, we recommend both soulbeasts run skirmishing and follow the <Trait name="Quickdraw"/> rotation below. It also works out well to replace Sword mainhand with Axe, as it allows you to stay in the middle on the 1st split meaning you can fit more skills into <Effect name="Exposed"/> on Phase 2.

</Boss>

<Tab title="4 Way Split">
<Warning>

Spirit Management:

- You should spawn your spirit at the entrance to the fractal and let it tick down to around 70% before starting to precast. This means the spirit will die after the first phase and you can resummon it before phase 2, where it will survive for the rest of the fight.

</Warning>

### **Pre-casting**

- When you are activating the Boss Challenge Mote run down to the boss platform and precast <Skill name="Frosttrap"/> on the boss like a <Specialization name="Dragonhunter"/> in disguise. Then /gg and wait up by the Mote until you are ready to precast.

- Pick up the <Skill id="5516"/> from your <Specialization name="Weaver"/>, then share <Skill name="One wolf pack"/> and finally take the _Mistlock Singularity_.

</Tab>

<Tab title="Portal Strat">
<Warning>

Spirit Management:

- This depends on how your <Specialization name="Renegade"/> plays, if they precast <Skill id="45686"/> before Skorvald spawns then you can summon your <Skill name="Frostspirit"/> down on the boss platform after the precast and the Kalla heal skill will sustain it until the second phase. In this scenario you don't teleport it at all you just leave it behind.

- If they don't do this then you will want to summon the spirit next to the Boss Challenge Mote and let it tick down in health for a couple of ticks and then pull it firstly down to Skorvald after the precast and then to the first island using <Skill name="Cold Snap"/> in order to kill it so it is back up for island 4 to be resummoned. This is the method described in the guide below.

</Warning>

- Pick up the <Skill id="5516"/> from your <Specialization name="Weaver"/>, then share <Skill name="One wolf pack"/> and finally take the _Mistlock Singularity_.

- Use <Skill id="5697"/> (Fiery Greatsword skill 3) to get down to the platform, teleport your <Skill name="Frostspirit"/> down to the platform then precast <Skill id="5531"/>, <Skill name="Barrage"/> and swap to sword/axe.

### **100%-66%**

- When your first <Skill name="Frosttrap"/> procs cast it again and use <Skill name="Onewolfpack"/>.
