      ### Utility skill variation:


      - If your <Specialization name="Renegade"/> runs <Skill name="Legendary Dwarf Stance"/>, you should play with <Skill name="sword of justice"/>.

      - Else (for example when <Specialization name="Renegade"/> plays <Skill name="Legendary Demon Stance"/> due to <Instability name="No Pain, No Gain"/>) take <Skill name="standyourground"/> to grant <Boon name="Stability"/> on the third island.


      ### Elite skill variation:

      <CMInformation title="Precast">


      <InformationBlock title="Overview">


      When prestacking in fractals we want to stack as many useful boons with as much duration as possible, these being <Boon name="Might"/>, <Boon name="Fury"/>, <Boon name="Quickness"/>, <Boon name="Alacrity"/> and <Boon name="Swiftness"/>. We can also cast useful unique effects, for a <Specialization name="Firebrand"/> this means your signets such as <Skill name="Banesignet"/>.


      As soon as you see <Skill name="moastance"/> from the <Specialization name="Soulbeast"/> on your bar lay down a fire field with <TomeSkill name="chapterscorchedaftermath"/> (F1-4), close the tome, blast with <Skill name="Shieldofwrath"/> (Focus 5) and stack boons with your mantras.

      <InformationBlock title="Island 1">


      You want to save your <Skill name="Leapoffaith"/> for the rift to the second island. Therefore you will most likely arrive last on the first island. Make sure to share <Boon name="Aegis"/> and <Boon name="Quickness"/> against the <Control name="Knockback"/> from the anomaly. Since you are last you have a good aim at your fellow friends and everyone will get the <Boon name="Aegis"/>. Finish the add with <Skill name="Whirlingwrath"/>.  

      For fast transitioning leap with <Skill name="Leapoffaith"/> towards the left side of the rift.


      </InformationBlock>


      <InformationBlock title="Island 2">


      Drop a <TomeSkill name="chapterscorchedaftermath"/> (F1-4) right when you land so your party has the chance to blast some <Boon name="Might"/>. While the anomaly is evading you can drop your <Skill name="symbolofresolution"/> and start casting <Skill name="whirlingwrath"/> just before you jump to avoid the <Control name="Knockback"/> circle attack.  

      Again, for fast transitioning leap with <Skill name="Leapoffaith"/> towards the left side of the rift and swap weapons in the rift.

      </InformationBlock>


      <InformationBlock title="Island 3">


      Drop a <Skill name="Swordofjustice"/> as soon as you land to quickly ramp up <Condition name="Vulnerability"/> up. This is key to kill the anomaly quickly! In case your team can't kill the anomaly before the first <Control name="Knockback"/> attack happens you should preemptively apply <Boon name="Stability"/> with <Skill name="Mantraofliberation"/>. Use <Skill name="symbol of blades"/> to keep up your stacks of <Trait name="Symbolicavenger"/>. Before you enter the rift open your <Skill name="tomeofjustice"/>!


      </InformationBlock>


      <InformationBlock title="Island 4">


      Drop a <TomeSkill name="chapterscorchedaftermath"/> (F1-4) right when you land so your party has the chance to blast some <Boon name="Might"/>. While the anomaly is evading blast <Boon name="Might"/> with <Skill name="Shieldofwrath"/>. Share your <Skill name="Banesignet"/> already! This is not an issue since phase 2 and 3 are each about 6-8 seconds long; so for the majority of the fight <Skill name="Banesignet"/> will be up. Just before the anomaly finishes its evade frame drop a <Skill name="Swordofjustice"/> for quick <Condition name="Vulnerability"/> ramp-up.  

      During our testing applying one stack of <Boon name="Stability"/> with <Skill name="Mantraofliberation"/> was not enough to reliably not get knockbacked by the anomaly, so it is recommended to jump!  

      You should stay at the anomaly till the very last moment since you do not have any important skills to precast on skorvald.
