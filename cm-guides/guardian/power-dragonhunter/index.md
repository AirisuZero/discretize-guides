<Warning>
This fight gets very messy if the adds are not immediately CCed. Especially at this fight it is recommended to grab extra CC skills to make up for the lack of CC of your team mates.

</Warning>

- Precast a <Skill id="30273"/> on the second Knight

- In fast groups you want to play with <Trait name="heavylight"/> instead of <Trait name="biggamehunter"/> 

</Boss>

### **Precast**

- Use <Skill name="Empower"/> to help with <Boon name="Might"/>. Blast the fire field with <Skill name="Holy Strike"/> and <Skill name="Mighty blow"/>.

- Use <Skill name="Feelmywrath"/>.

- You can use <Skill name="hallowed ground"/> for fire field and/or <Skill name="standyourground"/>.

- Take the _Mistlock Singularity_.

### **Synopsis**

- Start on Scepter/Sword.

- Try to use your full burst (either you start the phase on GS or sword/scepter) in each phase after breakbar is broken.

- Don't forget that you can not expect to see the highest numbers without the breakbar being frequently broken: to make that happen use <Skill name="banesignet"/>. <Specialization name="Renegade"/> and <Specialization name="Berserker"/> will not break the bar alone so DO NOT be selfish.

- Do not use traps on the adds.

- Use <Skill name="binding blade"/> inside MAMAs hitbox, when the small adds are coming close.

- Feel free to use <Skill name="symbol of blades"/>, <Skill name="leapoffaith"/> and <Skill name="wingsofresolve"/> for faster movement.

- You can take <Skill name="hammerofwisdom"/> to help CC the adds.

-   Use your <Skill name="Binding Blade"/> inside Siax' hitbox to get 5 additional hits. This is the reason why <Specialization name="Guardian"/> is very strong at this boss. Do not miss this.

- Use one <Skill id="9168"/> at the start of every phase and save one <Skill id="9168"/> for every add.

- It is beneficial to take a sword here to quickly blink to the add.

- Use <Skill name="Wings of resolve"/> to navigate around and keep your HP up.

- Use <Skill name="Bane Signet"/> to help with CC and buff your party.

- Use <Skill name="shieldofwrath"/> and <Skill name="Shieldofcourage"/> to block the expanding AoEs.

- Check with your team if you take <Skill name="Feelmywrath"/>

</Boss>

### **Precast**

- Precast your Traps (<Skill id="30364"/> and <Skill id="30273"/>) on the boss and force your team to `/gg`.

- Use <Skill name="Empower"/> to help with <Boon name="Might"/>. Blast the fire field with <Skill name="Holy Strike"/> and <Skill name="Mighty blow"/>.

- Take the _Mistlock Singularity_.

- You can precast <Skill id="29789"/> (LB4), <Skill id="9097"/> (Sw2) and <Skill id="9090"/> (Sc2) on the boss if you are using a portal.

### **100%-66%**

- Your gameplay is heavily influenced by the DPS your team can pull.

- If your team has very high DPS (phases Siax in >5s) you wanna precast <Skill name="Bane Signet"/> and fire everything you have as soon as you are getting in combat.

- No matter what group you are running with, start on scepter/sword!

- If you are running in a PuG or just clear it daily, it is beneficial to delay your traps slightly, to fit more of the hits into the cc bar.

- In a fast team save <Skill name="bindingblade"/> for the 2nd phase when the adds spawn, if not use it. Just make sure to press it when the adds are in range for big DPS.

- Use <Skill id="30364"/> and <Skill name="bindingblade"/> only if it's during second's phase expose up again.

### _1st Add_

- Use <Skill id="9168"/> for <Condition name="vulnerability"/> and damage.

- <Skill name="Whirling wrath"/> and a couple AA to kill it.

- Use <Skill name="wingsofresolve"/>, <Skill name="Symbol of blades"/> and <Skill name="Leapoffaith"/> for movement.

### **66%-33%**

Nothing extraordinary, all information from 100-66 and tl;dr are still valid. Try to end on scepter/sword.

### _2nd Add_

- Use <Skill id="9168"/> for <Condition name="vulnerability"/> and damage..

- Kill it with a symbol and AAs.

- In fast runs you might wanna save a <Skill name="Swordofjustice"/>.

### **33%-0%**

Nothing extraordinary, all information from 100-66 and tl;dr are still valid. Try to end on scepter/sword.

<Boss name="ensolyss" video="" videoCreator="" foodId="91805" utilityId="50082" heal="litanyofwrath" utility1="swordofjustice" utility2="processionofblades" utility3Id="9093" eliteId="29965" weapon1MainAffix="Berserker" weapon1MainType="Greatsword" weapon1MainSigil1="serpentslaying" weapon1MainSigil2="Impact" weapon1MainInfusion1Id="37131" weapon2OffAffix="Berserker" weapon2OffType="Focus" weapon2OffSigil="serpentslaying" weapon2OffInfusionId="37131" weapon2MainAffix="Berserker" weapon2MainType="Sword" weapon2MainSigil1="Impact" weapon2MainInfusion1Id="37131">
-   You can abuse <Skill name="bindingblade"/> here. After Ensolyss spawns the a circle under every party member there is a short period of time where these circles spawn an add which can be abused to get all hits with <Skill name="bindingblade"/>.

</Boss>

### **Synopsis**

- Breakbar should be broken at the start of the fight, use <Skill name="banesignet"/> to help to make it happen.

- Start on Scepter/Sword.

- Try to fit every single skill you have into <Effect name="Exposed"> (few seconds after the bar is broken), feel free to precast a symbol, and <Skill name="Swordofjustice"/> before Ensolyss becomes vulnerable.</Effect>

- After you used your full opener, continue with your usual rotation until you phase.

- Repeat this every single phase.

-   Bring <Skill name="feelmywrath"/> so your <Specialization name="Firebrand"/> doesn't have to. This will allow him to cover <Boon name="Stability"/> with <Skill name="Mantra Of Liberation"/>

- You can precast <Skill id="29789"/> (LB4), <Skill id="9097"/> (Sw2) and <Skill id="9090"/> (Sc2) on the boss.

- In fast groups you want to play with <Trait name="heavylight"/> instead of <Trait name="biggamehunter"/>

- Use <Skill name="Leap Of Faith"/> slightly left of the updrafts to travel quickly between islands.

</Boss>

<Phase>
<CMInformation title="Precast">

<InformationBlock title="Overview">

When prestacking in fractals we want to stack as many useful boons with as much duration as possible, these being <Boon name="Might"/>, <Boon name="Fury"/>, <Boon name="Quickness"/>, <Boon name="Alacrity"/> and <Boon name="Swiftness"/>. We can also cast useful unique effects, for a <Specialization name="Dragonhunter"/> this means your signets such as <Skill name="Banesignet"/>. Furthermore, it's important for a <Specialization name="Dragonhunter"/> to stack <Boon name="Resolution"/> since it boosts their strike damage thanks to <Trait name="Retribution"/>.

As soon as you see <Skill name="moastance"/> from the <Specialization name="Soulbeast"/> on your bar you can start your precast.

</InformationBlock>

<InformationBlock title="At the boss">

You don't have to precast every symbol, however it's recommended to always include <Skill id="29789"/> (LB4) since it's the strongest by far ever since the May 11th patch. Keep an eye on the <Skill name="Barrage"/> animation from the <Specialization name="Soulbeast"/> as you will be put in combat when he's done.

</InformationBlock>

</CMInformation>
  
<IdealRotation>

1.  Blast a fire field to generate <Boon name="Might"/> using <Skill name="Hammer Of Wisdom"/> and <Skill name="Shieldofwrath"/> (Focus 5). If your team is still short on blasts you could also use <Skill name="Holy Strike"/> (Staff 2)
2.  <Skill name="Save yourselves"/> to generate <Boon name="Resolution"/> for yourself
3.  <Skill name="Feelmywrath"/> to generate <Boon name="Quickness"/>
4.  <Skill name="BaneSignet"/>
5.  Take _Mistlock Singularity_ and approach the boss
6.  Symbol precast
7.  <Skill name="Shieldofwrath"/> (Focus 5)
8.  <Skill name="Procession of Blades"/>

</Phase>

<Phase>

<CMInformation title="Phase 1">

<InformationBlock title="Overview">

Phase 1 is heavily influenced by the DPS your team can pull. If your team has very high DPS (i.e. they phase Skorvald in less than 4 seconds) you can start on greatsword. Spam tab or use auto targeting to cc as soon as possible using <Skill name="Bane Signet"/> and finish the phase with <Skill id="9081"/>. Prepare to use <Skill id="30783"/> to travel towards the first island fast.

If the group dps isn't that high you can start on sword/focus instead, allowing you to fit in a <Skill id="9112"/> before swapping to greatsword.

<Phase>

<CMInformation title="Islands">

<InformationBlock title="Island 1">

Drop a <Skill name="Swordofjustice"/> as soon as you arrive. This in combination with <Skill id="9146"/> will ramp up <Condition name="Vulnerability"/> fast. Finish with <Skill id="9081"/> and use <Skill name="Leapoffaith"/> slightly left of the rift to travel to island 2.

</InformationBlock>

<InformationBlock title="Island 2">

While the anomaly is evading you can drop <Skill name="Procession of blades"/> and <Skill name="symbolofresolution"/>. Just before it lands, drop a <Skill name="Swordofjustice"/> and start casting <Skill name="whirlingwrath"/> right before you jump to avoid the <Control name="Knockback"/> circle attack. Make sure to instantly cancel your <Skill name="whirlingwrath"/> animation after the anomaly has died so it will be put on cooldown earlier.

</InformationBlock>

<InformationBlock title="Island 3">

Use <Skill id="9146"/> for <Condition name="Vulnerability"/> and to generate <Trait name="Symbolicavenger"/> stacks. Finish with <Skill id="9081"/>. You can use <Skill name="Leapoffaith"/> again to travel to island 4. **Swap weapons mid air, if you swap too late you will get in trouble during phase 2!**

</InformationBlock>

<InformationBlock title="Island 4">

Cast <Skill name="Bane Signet"/> before the anomaly jumps, otherwise people that leave early (mainly the <Specialization name="Soulbeast"/> precasting <Skill id="12469"/> ) will miss the buff! Blast a fire field with <Skill id="9082"/> to generate <Boon name="Might"/>, drop a <Skill id="9168"/> right before the anomaly lands and make sure to reduce its hp to 0% with <Skill id="9107"/> before you take the portal. (Unfortunately for us dragonhunters this fight is a soulbeast show in terms of target dps so we cannot afford to leave island 4 early).

</Phase>

<Phase>

<CMInformation title="Phase 2 and 3">

<InformationBlock title="Overview">

Do a standard burst rotation starting on sword/focus. You can use <Skill id="30039"/> after the phase to give your party long lasting <Boon name="aegis"/> to block the next <Control name="Knockback"/> on island 1.

Furthermore, it's important for a <Specialization name="Dragonhunter"/> to stack <Boon name="Resolution"/> since it boosts their strike damage thanks to <Trait name="Retribution"/>.

Precast your <Skill id="30273"/> on the northeast clone for cc and your <Skill name= "Test of Faith"/> on the tile near Artsariiv for extra damage in phase 1. Ideally everyone waits at Artsariiv together to give the <Specialization name="Renegade"/> more time to ~~precast~~ lag the game with casting <Boon name="Resistance"/>. Take the portal and blast with <Skill name="Shieldofwrath"/> (Focus 5) and <Skill name="hammerofwisdom"/>. To maximize the duration of <Skill name="Banesignet"/> use it as late as possible! You do not need to wait for the full aftercast before taking the _Mistlock Singularity_. If you are very quick, cast <Skill name="banesignet"/> again, however, this is only worth it if your party instatriggers the boss.

</InformationBlock>

<InformationBlock title="Portal to the boss">

Start casting symbols and make sure you also include <Skill name="Shieldofwrath"/> in your precast. Right before the boss triggers you can cast <Skill name= "Litany of Wrath"/> which allows you to stay in the hitbox and tank the laser. The precasted <Boon name="Resistance"/> from the <Specialization name="Renegade"/> protects you against the <Condition name="Fear"/> and <Condition name="Weakness"/>. Finish the precast with <Skill name="Procession of Blades"/>  and <Skill name="Swordofjustice"/>.

Switch weapons as soon as possible and cast <Skill name="Ray of Judgment"/> first, because it applies ticking damage and is therefore more valuable in combination with <Skill name="Onewolfpack"/>. Finish the phase with <Skill name="zealotsdefense"/> and <Skill name="symbolofblades"/>.

</Phase>

<Phase>

<CMInformation title="Phase 2">

<InformationBlock title="Overview">

It's best to start casting a couple of skills just before Artsariiv becomes vulnerable to steal some time, allowing you to fit more skills in. Start with <Skill name="Symbol of blades"/> into <Skill name="Swordofjustice"/> and <Skill name="Procession of Blades"/>. With those skills out of the way you can time it so <Skill name="spear of justice"/> connects with Artsariiv as soon as she becomes vulnerable. Follow up with <Skill name="Ray of Judgment"/> into <Skill name="zealotsdefense"/> and fit in another <Skill name="Swordofjustice"/> before swapping to greatsword. Use <Skill name="symbol of resolution"/> into  <Skill name="whirlingwrath"/> and finish with <Skill name="Bindingblade"/>.

You don't have to worry about dodging the expanding circle <Control name="Knockback"/> attack since the <Specialization name="Renegade"/> will provide <Boon name="Stability"/> and the <Specialization name="Firebrand"/> covers <Boon name="Aegis"/>.

If done correctly, you should be able to fit in atleast 2x <Skill name="Swordofjustice"/> in the rotation. Make sure your rotation is fast so you can be on greatsword just before Artsariiv's expanding circle attack hits otherwise you lose out on <Skill name="symbol of resolution"/> hits.

After the mid burst, use your <SpecialActionKey name="hypernovalaunch"/> to jump to Artsariiv and finish the phase in the corner. In case the team is slow, the <Specialization name="Firebrand"/> can reflect Artsariiv's `Taw Shot` attack with <TomeSkill name="Chapter 3: Valiant Bulwark"/>.

<InformationBlock title="Southwest adds">

Use <SpecialActionKey name="hypernovalaunch"/> as soon as you can to jump to the two southwest adds. You will CC these clones together with the <Specialization name="Firebrand"/>. Since <Skill name="Bindingblade"/> for CC cannot be applied at the same time, you will have to wait for the <Specialization name="Firebrand"/> until he has used it first. In the meantime you use <Skill name="leapoffaith"/> to CC the south add and use <Skill name="symbol of resolution"/> to upkeep <Trait name="Symbolicavenger"/> stacks. You can savely use <Skill name="Bindingblade"/> to CC after that without causing any conflicts.

-   Play scepter on this encounter

- Place markers for the blooms

- Precast your Traps (<Skill id="30364"/> and <Skill id="30273"/>) on the boss.

- You can precast <Skill id="29789"/> (LB4), <Skill id="9097"/> (Sw2) and <Skill id="9090"/> (Sc2) on the boss if you are using a portal.

</Boss>

### **Synopsis**

- Play scepter here!

- Good teams: start on scepter/sword, so that you are on scepter during the bloom phase.

- Bad teams: start on greatsword and do SC rotation

- Your goal is to start on scepter/sword at every 10% burn phase, that is why you need to consider weapon swaps carefully.

- Use <Skill name="binding blade"/> to pull adds. Do not abuse it to farm DPS! Not pulling the adds might kill you during the bloom phase and cost more DPS!

- Timings to use <Skill name="banesignet"/>:

  1.  Use it two times at the singularity before the encounter starts.

  2.  Use it slightly before phase 3, 5 and 6 start.

- There are two ways to do the blooms fast:

  1.  Walk into the lightning and auto-attack with the scepter. Use <Skill name="Wings of Resolve"/> to jump back to the middle.

  2.  Walk into the lightning and auto-attack with the greatsword. After the bloom bounces towards the pillar use <Skill name="Leap of faith"/> on the bloom to finish it. Immediately use <SpecialActionKey name="hypernovalaunch"/> to jump back into the middle.
