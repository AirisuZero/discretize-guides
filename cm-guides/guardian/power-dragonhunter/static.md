### **General Knowledge**

<Warning>
Many of the following tips can also be found on the original <BuildLink build="Power Dragonhunter" specialization="Dragonhunter"/> guide page, as well as complementary tips on symbol precasts, and more <Specialization name="Dragonhunter" text="Dragonhunter"/> tips. *Make sure to check the* ***Advanced*** *of the <BuildLink build="Power Dragonhunter" specialization="Dragonhunter"/> section to get a full perspective*.
</Warning>

#### **Common tips to improve on <Specialization name="Guardian" text="Guardian"/>**
Major tips are listed in the **Advanced Tips** section of the ***Advanced*** page of the <BuildLink build="Power Dragonhunter" specialization="Dragonhunter"/> guide.


#### **Mistlock precasts**
- If playing **Radiance**, always precast <Skill name="hallowedground"/> and <Skill name="litanyofwrath"/> for  <Boon name="resolution"/> uptime. Blasts can we done with two abilities,  <Skill name="shieldofwrath"/> and  <Skill name="holystrike"/> or  <Skill name="mightyblow"/>. Precast  <Skill name="feelmywrath"/>.
- If playing **Virtues**, make sure to also cast  <Skill name="saveyourselves"/> Over  <Skill name="hallowedground"/>, or both if you can afford to do so on your precasting template.
- Tip for **Virtues**: casting "Save Yourselves!" and pressing the Singularity at the same Time will allow for multiple casts of the ability.

#### **Trap Precasts** 

- All traps but  <Skill name="lightsjudgment"/> and  <Skill name="processionofblades"/> remain on the ground upon switching between Dragonhunter templates only. Sometimes, you may want to precast  <Skill name="procession of blades"/> on a boss' location, in which case you will have to have  <Skill name="hallowedground"/> both on your precasting template (if you have one), and on your actual template you want to use during the fight. Make sure to always have the same exact traits on both templates, otherwise you will be struck by the infamous *Status Reset*.

#### **A reminder on Symbol Precasts**

*Symbol Precasts* is the name given to the action of going through different weapons, and casting as many symbols as possible before an encounter begins. This can significantly improve the <Specialization name="Guardian" text="Guardian"/>'s initial burst and, consequently, its overall damage at the end of the fight (provided the boss is killed quickly enough). This technique is especially useful for boss kill records and fractal speedruns, but mostly anectodal in daily runs. 

**Disclaimer: precasting symbols is risky in unorganized runs, as you never know when a player will activate the boss. It needs practice and a conciliant party.**
Here are a few practical tips in order to achieve proper symbol precasting:
- Switching from a weapon to another weapon will always interrupt any ongoing action. Make sure to always finish casting your symbols before changing to a different weapon. The best way to achieve symbol precasting is to switch from weapon to weapon using an opened Inventory.
- In the Inventory, position the weapons you need in a straight line or in a square shape at the very top of it; find something practical for you for frequent use. Make sure you have a fifth slot for the focus as well, so it *always* drops down in the right place every time you equip and unequip it. The use of Ascended weapons is an absolute must. Do NOT share any ascended weapons between templates. Make sure to have unique ascended weapons for each template you need.
- The priority when passing through different weapons to precast symbols is: *Scepter → Sword + Focus → Staff → Longbow*. If starting the boss on *Greatsword*, you can replace *Longbow* with it in this priority list.
-  To make things easier, always equip your *Scepter* and *Focus* **beforehand**, over the weapon you would usually start the encounter with. *Scepter* always comes first. If you wish to add a fifth symbol, you can equip a *Mace* instead, and it can be cast as you traverse a portal to the boss. Switch to *Scepter*, cast as <Skill name="symbolofpunishment"/>, then switch to *Sword*, cast <Skill name="symbolofblades"/> and <Skill name="shieldofwrath"/> as it goes off, then *Staff* (<Skill name="symbolofswiftness"/>), *Longbow* (<Skill name="symbolofenergy"/>), and finally your weapon of choice and its symbol for the start of the encounter.

Many examples of symbol precasting can be found in the subsequent video, linked below for every boss encounter.

<Warning>
- This fight gets very messy if the adds are not immediately CCed. It is recommended to use extra CC skills to make up for the potential lack of CC of your team mates, such as <Skill name="banesignet"/>.
- It is possible to precast a <Skill id="30273"/> on the second Knight, if a portal to go back is available.
- <Trait name="heavylight"/> is required.
</Warning>

### **Synopsis**
- Start the boss on *Longbow*. It is recommended not to precast more than 2 symbols on MAMA (aim for the edge of the hitbox, to the left of the boss upon walking to it), preferably *Sword* and *Scepter*.
- Try to use your full burst in each phase after the defiance bar is broken.
- Don't forget that you can not expect to see the highest numbers without the breakbar being frequently broken: to make that happen use <Skill name="banesignet"/>.
- Do not use traps on the adds.
- Use <Skill name="binding blade"/> *inside* the first knight's hitbox, and then in MAMA's hitbox during fight, when the small adds are coming close.
- Feel free to use <Skill name="leapoffaith"/> and <Skill name="wingsofresolve"/> for faster movement.

<Warning>
- <Skill name="bindingblade"/> can be abused here. After Ensolyss body slams the party, a bunch of shadow echos will appear on every player, locking them with a delayed damaging AoE. These echos act just like adds and can be bound by <Skill name="bindingblade"/>. They stay up for a short period of time. The following rotation does not take this into account and uses binding blade earlier, in order not to delay the second round of *Longbow* abilities.
- Both <Trait name="biggamehunter"/> and <Trait name="heavylight"/> can be used here, but the latter should be slightly worse, as Ensolyss is a tanky boss which doesn't easily spend most of its time CCd.
</Warning>

### **Synopsis**

- Start on *Longbow*.
- Breakbar should be broken at the start of the fight, use <Skill name="dragonsmaw"/> and then <Skill name="deflectingshot"/> to help to make it happen.
- Try to fit every single skill you have into <Effect name="Exposed"> (few seconds after the bar is broken), feel free to precast a symbol, and <Skill name="Swordofjustice"/> before Ensolyss becomes vulnerable.</Effect>
- After you used your full opener, continue with your usual rotation until you phase.
- Repeat this every single phase.

When prestacking in fractals we want to stack as many useful boons with as much duration as possible, these being <Boon name="Might"/>, <Boon name="Fury"/>, <Boon name="Quickness"/>, <Boon name="Alacrity"/> and <Boon name="Swiftness"/>. We can also cast useful unique effects, for a <Specialization name="Dragonhunter"/> this means your signets such as <Skill name="Banesignet"/>. Furthermore, it's important for a <Specialization name="Dragonhunter"/> to stack <Boon name="Resolution"/> since it boosts their strike damage thanks to <Trait name="Retribution"/>.

- If your team aims for a double midburn, theres no need for <Skill name="Wall of reflection"/> as you want to finish the boss before the corner. 
- Save a <Skill name="shieldofcourage"/> for the expanding AoE so you and your party can deal continues DPS during the mid burn.
- Precast a <Skill id="30273"/> on the northeast clone
- Always start on greatsword!

<CMInformation title="Precast">

<InformationBlock title="Overview">

When prestacking in fractals we want to stack as many useful boons with as much duration as possible, these being <Boon name="Might"/>, <Boon name="Fury"/>, <Boon name="Quickness"/>, <Boon name="Alacrity"/> and <Boon name="Swiftness"/>. We can also cast useful unique effects, for a <Specialization name="Dragonhunter"/> this means your signets such as <Skill name="Banesignet"/>. Furthermore, it's important for a <Specialization name="Dragonhunter"/> to stack <Boon name="Resolution"/> since it boosts their strike damage thanks to <Trait name="Retribution"/>.

Precast your <Skill id="30273"/> on the northeast clone for cc and your <Skill name="Test of Faith"/> on the tile near Artsariiv for extra damage in phase 1. Ideally everyone waits at Artsariiv together to give the <Specialization name="Renegade"/> more time to ~~precast~~ lag the game with casting <Boon name="Resistance"/>. Take the portal and blast with <Skill name="Shieldofwrath"/> (Focus 5) and <Skill name="hammerofwisdom"/>. To maximize the duration of <Skill name="Banesignet"/> use it as late as possible! You do not need to wait for the full aftercast before taking the _Mistlock Singularity_. If you are very quick, cast <Skill name="banesignet"/> again, however, this is only worth it if your party instatriggers the boss.

</InformationBlock>

<InformationBlock title="Portal to the boss">

Start casting symbols and make sure you also include <Skill name="Shieldofwrath"/> in your precast. Right before the boss triggers you can cast <Skill name="Litany of Wrath"/> which allows you to stay in the hitbox and tank the laser. The precasted <Boon name="Resistance"/> from the <Specialization name="Renegade"/> protects you against the <Condition name="Fear"/> and <Condition name="Weakness"/>. Finish the precast with <Skill name="Procession of Blades"/> and <Skill name="Swordofjustice"/>.

<InformationBlock title="Overview">

Try to time it so <Skill name="spear of justice"/> connects with Artsariiv right as she becomes vulnerable. Use <Skill name="symbol of resolution"/> (If not already precasted) and follow up with <Skill name="whirlingwrath"/>, into <Skill name="Bindingblade"/> (**dont miss this!**) due to multiple targets around the boss this skill will hit up to 5 times provided you use it in the bosses hitbox.

Switch weapons as soon as possible and cast <Skill name="Ray of Judgment"/> first, because it applies ticking damage and is therefore more valuable in combination with <Skill name="Onewolfpack"/>. Finish the phase with <Skill name="zealotsdefense"/> and <Skill name="symbolofblades"/>.

<CMInformation title="Phase 2">

<InformationBlock title="Overview">

It's best to start casting a couple of skills just before Artsariiv becomes vulnerable to steal some time, allowing you to fit more skills in. Start with <Skill name="Symbol of blades"/> into <Skill name="Swordofjustice"/> and <Skill name="Procession of Blades"/>. With those skills out of the way you can time it so <Skill name="spear of justice"/> connects with Artsariiv as soon as she becomes vulnerable. Follow up with <Skill name="Ray of Judgment"/> into <Skill name="zealotsdefense"/> and fit in another <Skill name="Swordofjustice"/> before swapping to greatsword. Use <Skill name="symbol of resolution"/> into <Skill name="whirlingwrath"/> and finish with <Skill name="Bindingblade"/>.

You don't have to worry about dodging the expanding circle <Control name="Knockback"/> attack since the <Specialization name="Renegade"/> will provide <Boon name="Stability"/> and the <Specialization name="Firebrand"/> covers <Boon name="Aegis"/>.

If done correctly, you should be able to fit in atleast 2x <Skill name="Swordofjustice"/> in the rotation. Make sure your rotation is fast so you can be on greatsword just before Artsariiv's expanding circle attack hits otherwise you lose out on <Skill name="symbol of resolution"/> hits.

After the mid burst, use your <SpecialActionKey name="hypernovalaunch"/> to jump to Artsariiv and finish the phase in the corner. In case the team is slow, the <Specialization name="Firebrand"/> can reflect Artsariiv's `Taw Shot` attack with <Skill name="Chapter 3: Valiant Bulwark"/>.

<InformationBlock title="Southwest adds">

Use <SpecialActionKey name="hypernovalaunch"/> as soon as you can to jump to the two southwest adds. You will CC these clones together with the <Specialization name="Firebrand"/>. Since <Skill name="Bindingblade"/> for CC cannot be applied at the same time, you will have to wait for the <Specialization name="Firebrand"/> until he has used it first. In the meantime you use <Skill name="leapoffaith"/> to CC the south add and use <Skill name="symbol of resolution"/> to upkeep <Trait name="Symbolicavenger"/> stacks. You can savely use <Skill name="Bindingblade"/> to CC after that without causing any conflicts.

- Place markers for the blooms
- Precast your Traps (<Skill id="30364"/> and <Skill id="30273"/>) on the boss.
- You can precast <Skill id="29789"/> (LB4), <Skill id="9097"/> (Sw2) and <Skill id="9090"/> (Sc2) on the boss if you are using a portal.

### **Synopsis**

- Play scepter here!
- Good teams: start on scepter/sword, so that you are on scepter during the bloom phase.
- Bad teams: start on greatsword and do SC rotation
- Your goal is to start on scepter/sword at every 10% burn phase, that is why you need to consider weapon swaps carefully.
- Use <Skill name="binding blade"/> to pull adds. Do not abuse it to farm DPS! Not pulling the adds might kill you during the bloom phase and cost more DPS!
- Timings to use <Skill name="banesignet"/>:
  1.  Use it two times at the singularity before the encounter starts.
  2.  Use it slightly before phase 3, 5 and 6 start.
- There are two ways to do the blooms fast:
  1.  Walk into the lightning and auto-attack with the scepter. Use <Skill name="Wings of Resolve"/> to jump back to the middle.
  2.  Walk into the lightning and auto-attack with the greatsword. After the bloom bounces towards the pillar use <Skill name="Leap of faith"/> on the bloom to finish it. Immediately use <SpecialActionKey name="hypernovalaunch"/> to jump back into the middle.
