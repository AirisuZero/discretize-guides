## What is necessary to clear fractals efficiently?

It boils down to five important concepts that need to be fulfilled permanently while in combat. Failing one of these will decelerate the speed and smoothness of the run:

1. Boons: 25 stacks of <Boon name="Might"/>, <Boon name="Fury"/>, <Boon name="Quickness"/> and <Boon name="Alacrity"/>.
2. Conditions: 25 stacks of <Condition name="Vulnerability"/>, along with any unique condis that your class needs to gain damage modifiers.
3. Breaking [CC bars](guides/cc-distribution) to gain the damage modifier from <Effect name="Exposed"/>.
4. High and fast group single target burst potential.
5. Using strong damaging class skills such as <Skill name="Spider Venom"/> or <Skill name="onewolfpack"/>

<Warning>
It is vital to understand that these concepts in conjunction create massive amounts of burst causing phases to only last a few seconds (even with condi classes). This is also due to the fact that the <Effect name="Exposed"/> modifier stacks multiplicative with many other damage modifiers.

The gameplay is therefore much more fast paced compared to raids and requires different thinking and rotations that are tailored around the <Effect name="Exposed"/> window.
</Warning>

For T4s there are several other important concepts: 

1. Projectile reflects and <Boon name="Stability"/>.
2. High cleave damage.
3. Fast movement using leaps, blinks and teleports to perform skips for the team.
4. <Effect name="Stealth"/> to skip trash mobs.

## What and how do I play in PuGs? 

PuGs rarely play optimally as a group, causing people to generally deal lower damage and perform worse overall due to lack of synergy. If you are one of those that seek to improve we highly encourage you to find a static via our `#looking-for-static` channel on [Discord](https://discord.gg/NpS2gN5) or [apply to Discretize](apply). We encourage the fractal community to strive for self-improvement and help in any possible way on our Discord server or in-game.

For people without the time to do this, we recommend quite an open comp when using the in-game lfg. Whilst every class in the game has multiple strong builds for fractals, it is still important to build your party around certain boons to help have a somewhat efficient clear.

By building your party around the following concepts you will find an in-game lfg run in most cases is much faster and smoother than just taking any old build. You first want to look at covering the important boons: <Boon name="Might" text="25 Might"/>, <Boon name="Fury"/>, <Boon name="Quickness"/> and <Boon name="Alacrity"/>. Also you want to aim as a group to be able to maintain <Condition name="vulnerability" text="25 Vulnerability"/> on your targets. Finally builds that can bring high CC and damage mitigation such as reflects, <Boon name="Aegis"/> and <Boon name="Stability"/> are much more beneficial to run than pure damage dealers.

<Warning>
The compositions below are what we consider to be strong options, with support builds that synergise well and are capable of handling all fractal mechanics, leading to quick, consistent and smooth runs at all gameplay levels. Every class in the game has at least one option for a boon heal, boon dps, power dps, and condition dps build that is sufficient to play in fractals and can be taken as alternate options to the builds below.

We would like to note however, that boon builds such as <Specialization name="Mechanist"/>, <Specialization name="Druid"/>, or <Specialization name="Tempest"/> while providing all of the necessary boon support and healing, can sometimes have less access to damage mitigation or only one skill that provides <Boon name="Stability"/> and <Boon name="Aegis"/>. This is fine as long as other people in your party recognise this and adapt their playstyle or builds to help, but if their atitude is for the healer to solo carry the group, these builds can be much harder to play.
</Warning>

### Recommended Power Composition
This composition is typically taken on most normal mode fractals, Nightmare CM, and Shattered Observatory CM.
| | |
|-|-|
| <Specialization name="Chronomancer" size="big" disable text/> | <BuildLink build="Heal Boon Chronomancer" specialization="Chronomancer"/> is one of the strongest, if not the strongest heal build currently for fractals. It can provide either <Boon name="Alacrity"/> or <Boon name="Quickness"/>, as well as 25 stacks of <Boon name="Might"/> and <Boon name="Fury"/>. It has multiple options for on demand <Boon name="Stability"/> and <Boon name="Aegis"/>, as well as other mitigation such as reflects, plenty of condi cleanse and Crowd Control. Finally it has a unique toolkit for T4s with access to blinks and movement abilities for skips along with <Effect name="Stealth"/> and some <Effect name="Superspeed"/>. In this composition it is used as an <Boon name="Alacrity"/> provider. <br/> **Alternative Options** - If the heal spot is being played as a <Boon name="Quickness"/> provider, or you are in a  no heal group. We recommend playing <BuildLink build="Power Renegade" specialization="Renegade"/> or <Specialization name="Willbender" text="Power Alac Willbender"/> in this slot.|
| <Specialization name="Scrapper" size="big" disable text/> | <BuildLink build="Power Scrapper" specialization="Scrapper"/> is a strong <Boon name="Quickness"/> DPS option. It provides large amounts of Crowd Control, <Effect name="Stealth"/>, and <Effect name="Superspeed"/>, making T4 fractals easy. It also has High target and cleave damage, along with Boon stip on <Skill name="Throw Mine"/> effectively dealing with <Instability name="No Pain, No Gain"/>. Through <Skill name="Blast Gyro"/> it is also capable of helping maintain party <Boon name="Might"/>. <br/> **Alternative Options** - For a more defensive option <BuildLink build="Power Herald" specialization="Herald"/> can be taken. Or, if you have a <Boon name="Alacrity"/> DPS provider, <BuildLink build="Heal Boon Chronomancer" specialization="Chronomancer"/> or <BuildLink build="Heal Firebrand"  specialization="Firebrand"/> can be played as a <Boon name="Quickness"/> heal option. |
| Power DPS | The final three spots are for pure DPS builds. In PuGs whether a build is META or not doesn't matter. All that matters is if the build is a good build, which every class in the game is capable of making. A good build has an equipment combination, traits, and  skills that make sense for the encounter it is being played on. Try to pick a build that complements the rest of the party and be willing to compromise if the boon supports need extra help with situational boons (such as <Boon name="Stability"/> or <Boon name="Aegis"/>), condi cleanse, or providing some boon strips if needed. |

### Recommended Condition Composition
This composition is typically taken on Sunqua Peak CM, Silent Surf CM, and can be beneficial to run on some T4s. 
| | |
|-|-|
| <Specialization name="Chronomancer" size="big" disable text/> | <BuildLink build="Heal Boon Chronomancer" specialization="Chronomancer"/> is one of the strongest, if not the strongest heal build currently for fractals. It can provide either <Boon name="Alacrity"/> or <Boon name="Quickness"/>, as well as 25 stacks of <Boon name="Might"/> and <Boon name="Fury"/>. It has multiple options for on demand <Boon name="Stability"/> and <Boon name="Aegis"/>, as well as other mitigation such as reflects, plenty of condi cleanse and Crowd Control. Finally it has a unique toolkit for T4s with access to blinks and movement abilities for skips along with <Effect name="Stealth"/> and some <Effect name="Superspeed"/>. In this composition it is used as an <Boon name="Alacrity"/> provider. <br/> **Alternative Options** - If the heal spot is being played as a <Boon name="Quickness"/> provider, or you are in a  no heal group. We recommend playing <BuildLink build="Condition Specter" specialization="Specter"/> or <BuildLink build="Condi Alac Renegade" specialization="Renegade"/> in this slot. Alternatively if you feel like your group doesnt need a full healer, <BuildLink build="Celestial Scourge" specialization="Scourge"/> is an incredibly strong hybrid build that is great for more confident groups. |
| <Specialization name="Harbinger" size="big" disable text/> | <BuildLink build="Condition Harbinger" specialization="Harbinger"/> is a strong <Boon name="Quickness"/> DPS option. It has access to a decent amount of CC and can swap a utility to <Skill name="Spectral Grasp"/> if needed, Provides a large amount of <Condition name="Vulnerability"/>, and also helps with <Boon name="Might"/> uptime. It does require attention to play, due to the <Effect name="Blight"/> mechanic, which lowers your maximum health making some instability combinations potentially lethal. <br/> **Alternative Options** - For a more defensive option <Specialization name="Herald" text="Condition Quickness Herald"/> can be taken. Or, if you have a <Boon name="Alacrity"/> DPS provider, <BuildLink build="Heal Boon Chronomancer" specialization="Chronomancer"/> or <BuildLink build="Heal Firebrand"  specialization="Firebrand"/> can be played as a <Boon name="Quickness"/> heal option. |

## What are the differences between the organized groups and how PuGs play?

One of the biggest differences is, that they don't always understand how their actions translate into the game. Learning to do the mechanics correctly, flawlessly, and reliably is - in the beginning - the most important task. PuGs assume the worst usually, so one player in the party is a healer instead.

Another difference is that PuGs often claim, that CC is solely the job of the supports. That is not true since they can only knock out **about half** of the bars. CC is a group effort involving **all** party members, **EVEN IN CONDITION COMPS!**

Many PuGs like to play <Specialization name="Virtuoso"/> or <Specialization name="Scourge"/>. That is just fine as you don't know what to expect of your fellow PuG mates and you prefer to be self-sufficient. But please don't be afraid to run more supportive skills such as <Skill name="Signet of Humility"/> or <Skill name="Spectral Grasp"/>! It is more worth it than the +500 DPS you gain from having a minor dps utility instead.

## Adjusting your gear for the encounter
When playing in PuG groups you will often find a huge disparity in damage being dealt by players (even when playing the same build). While this doesn't take into account differences in rotation, or account augmentations such as <Augmentation name="Mist Attunement 4"/>, by adjusting your build to the encounter can have a significant impact in the damage you are dealing. While you are not forced to do this, if you want to optimise your gameplay, it is a good place to start.

If you take <BuildLink build="Power Soulbeast" specialization="Soulbeast"/>, the standard setup runs with <Item id="24615"/>, <Item id="24868"/>, <Item id="91805"/>, and <Item id="9443"/>. However some encounters allow you to use Slaying Sigils and Potions, or you can proc on kill food. Using the [gear optimizer](https://optimizer.discretize.eu/?s=wmPELQkev1), with these settings we can see how much of a percentage increase adjusting the build will do.

| <Item id="91805"/> + <br/> <Item id="9443"/> + <br/> <Item id="24868"/> (Only 3%) | <Item id="43360"/> (100% Uptime) + <br/> <Item id="50082"/> + <br/> <Item id="24658"/> | 15.9%           |

Low Standards \[LS] is an EU community discord server, that is operating as a second, more restricted LFG for no heal daily runs.

Thanks to different pingable roles and class-emojis, members are able to organize their run without the commitment of a static or any need of LFG waiting times.

In order to guarantee a high level of play, everyone needs to be capable of executing strategies inside of a no-heal environment with at least one of the meta-classes.
For evaluation, we are going to ask new applicants for arcdps logs as a requirement.

All information is available on their [Discord](https://dsc.gg/low-standards).

## What are strong comps for organised groups?

<Warning>
It is important to note, that each challenge mote encounter has a different effective composition, which is often different to the proposed compositions below. Discretize focuses on clearing daily fractals efficiently, and the proposed compositions brings enough utility to deal with all situations that are occurring in fractals without needing to relog to another character for every boss or fractal. To see examples of these check out the [dT Daily Comps](/guides/daily-comp).
