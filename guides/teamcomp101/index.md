## What is necessary to clear fractals efficiently?

It boils down to five important concepts that need to be fulfilled permanently while in combat. Failing one of these will decelerate the speed and smoothness of the run:

1. Boons: 25 stacks of <Boon name="Might"/>, <Boon name="Fury"/>, <Boon name="Quickness"/> and <Boon name="Alacrity"/>.
2. Conditions: 25 stacks of <Condition name="vulnerability"/>, along with any unique condis that your class needs to gain damage modifiers.
3. Breaking [CC bars](guides/cc-distribution) to gain the damage modifier from <Effect name="Exposed"/>.
4. High and fast group single target burst potential.
5. Stacking unique damage buffs such as <Skill name="banesignet"/> or <Skill name="onewolfpack"/>

<Warning>
It is vital to understand that these concepts in conjunction create massive amounts of burst causing phases to only last a few seconds (even with condi classes). This is also due to the fact that the <Effect name="Exposed"/> modifier stacks multiplicative with many other damage modifiers.

The gameplay is therefore much more fast paced compared to raids and requires different thinking and rotations that are tailored around the <Effect name="Exposed"/> window.
</Warning>

For T4s there are several other important concepts:

1. Projectile reflects and <Boon name="Stability"/>.
2. High cleave damage.
3. Fast movement using leaps, blinks and teleports to perform skips for the team.
4. <Effect name="Stealth"/> to skip trash mobs.

## What and how do I play in PuGs?

PuGs rarely play optimally as a group, causing people to generally deal lower damage and perform worse overall due to lack of synergy. If you are one of those that seek to improve we highly encourage you to find a static via our `#looking-for-static` channel on [discord](https://discord.gg/NpS2gN5) or [apply to Discretize](apply). We encourage the fractal community to strive for self-improvement and help in any possible way on our discord server or in-game.

For people without the time to do this, we reccomend quite an open comp when using the in game lfg. Whilst every class in the game has multiple strong builds for fractals, it is still important to build your party around certain boons to help have a somewhat efficient clear.

By building your party around the following concepts you will find an in game lfg run in most cases is much faster and smoother than just taking any old build. You first want to look at covering the important boons: <Boon name="Might" text="25 Might"/>, <Boon name="Fury"/>, <Boon name="Quickness"/> and <Boon name="Alacrity"/>. Also you want to aim as a group to be able to maintain <Condition name="vulnerability" text="25 Vulnerability"/> on your targets. Finally builds that can bring high CC and damage mitigation such as reflects, <Boon name="Aegis"/> and <Boon name="Stability"/> are much more beneficial to run than pure damage dealers.
<Warning>
Although both condition and power builds preform great in PuGs, it is recommended to choose between a condition or power comp before starting. This is because you will want to CC bosses at different times depending on the comp and will affect the damage output of some classes. It should also be noted that condition comps are significantly easier to play and currently in most cases faster overall than power based comps, with a **significantly higher success rate!**

## What are the differences between the organized groups and how PuGs play?

One of the biggest difference is, that they don't always understand how their actions translate into the game. Learning to do the mechanics correctly, flawlessly, and reliably is - in the beginning - the most important task. PuGs assume the worst usually, so one player in the party is a healer instead.

Another difference is that PuGs often claim, that CC is solely the job of the <Specialization name="Renegade"/>. That is not true since <Specialization name="Renegade"/> can only knock out **about half** of the bars. CC is a group effort involving **all** party members, **EVEN IN CONDI COMPS!**

Many PuGs like to play <Specialization name="Firebrand"/> or <Specialization name="Scourge"/>. That is just fine as you don't know what to expect of your fellow PuG mates and you prefer to be self-sufficient. But please don't be afraid to run more supportive skills such as <Skill name="Sanctuary"/> or <Skill name="Spectral Grasp"/>! It is more worth it than the +500 DPS you gain from having a minor dps utility instead.

## What are strong comps for organised groups?

<Warning>
It is important to note, that each challenge mote encounter has a different effective composition, which is often different to the proposed compositions below. Discretize focuses on clearing daily fractals efficiently, and the proposed compositions brings enough utility to deal with all situations that are occurring in fractals without needing to relog to another character for every boss or fractal. 
</Warning>

With the May 11th 2021 balance patch came a huge shake up to fractal compositions due to the <Effect name="Exposed"/> change. Instead of being a 50% damage modifier, it was nerfed to 30% power and buffed to 100% condi damage, which has since been changed to a 10% power increase and 20% condition in March 2022.

This has led to condition builds becoming competitive with power builds on many fractals, even in high end groups. This has led to a big split between daily run comps and boss kill comps. For individual bosses power still shines and in most cases can get much faster kills than condi comps can (apart from Ensolyss and 100CM), but for full runs due to the minimal time needed to precast, ease of the comp and the fact it gets similar if not faster times to power runs, for most groups condi comps tend to be a safer pick.

With this in mind we have two comps we use for our runs. A <Composition name="Daily Condi" composition="Renegade,Firebrand,Firebrand,Specter, DPS" roles="Alacrity/CC/DPS,Quickness/CC/DPS,Quickness/CC/DPS,Venoms/CC/DPS, Any DPS" size="small"/> comp for runs where people want to get in and out asap with minimal effort. And a <Composition name="Daily Power" composition="Renegade,Firebrand,Dragonhunter,Soulbeast,Soulbeast" roles="Alacrity/CC/DPS,Quickness/CC/DPS,CC/DPS,Frost Spirit/CC/DPS,Spotter/CC/DPS" size="small"/> comp for days when groups want to get some faster boss kills requiring more co-ordination.

<Warning>
For groups such as PuGs or statics less focused on optimal strats and comps used changes entirely. To find out more information about what changes scroll up to the PuG section.
</Warning>

### <Composition name="Daily Condi" composition="Renegade,Firebrand,Firebrand,Specter, DPS" roles="Alacrity/CC/DPS,Quickness/CC/DPS,Quickness/CC/DPS,Venoms/CC/DPS, Any DPS" size="small"/>

As mentioned above this comp is ran for an easy daily clear without class swapping. It has high burst for a condi comp with lots of sustain, while being easy to play regardless of instabilities, performing well on every encounter. Read below to see why each class is taken;

<Tabs>
<Tab specialization="Renegade">

- Provides permanent <Boon name="Alacrity"/> and around 10 stacks of <Boon name="Might"/>.
- Deals a large amount of CC through <Skill name="Darkrazors Daring"/> and <Skill name="Scorchrazor"/>
- Deals a good amount of damage, coming close or beating other classes on some encounters
- Has blinks available from skills such as <Skill name="phasetraversal"/>

<BuildLink build="Condi Alac Renegade" specialization="Renegade"/>
</Tab>

<Tab specialization="Firebrand">

- Provides permanent <Boon name="Quickness"/>, on demand <Boon name="Aegis"/>, <Boon name="Resistance"/> and some <Boon name="Might"/>.
- Generates a fair share of <Boon name="Fury"/> by <Skill name="Feel my wrath"/> and the sword symbol <Skill name="Symbol of Vengeance"/>.
- Deals a decent amount of DPS with reasonable burst. Also by playing two <Specialization name="Firebrand"/> you can run <Trait name="Legendary Lore"/> for even more damage while still maintaining <Boon name="Quickness"/>.
- Contributes a huge amount of CC with <Skill name="sanctuary"/>.
- Provides a party damage increase through Ashes of the Just (Tome 1-5).
- Can provide situational <Boon name="Stability"/> using <Skill name="Stand your ground"/>, <Skill name="Tome of Courage"/> and <Skill name="Mantra of Liberation"/>.

<BuildLink build="Condi Firebrand" specialization="Firebrand"/>
</Tab>

<Tab specialization="Specter">

- Currently one of the highest bursting condi classes in the game
- Provides strong party dps buffs through <Skill name="Spider Venom"/> and <Skill name="Skale Venom"/>.
- Provides a massive amount of CC by sharing <Skill name="Basilisk Venom"/>.
- Has high mobility with many blinks, portals and <Effect name="Stealth"/>, great for skips and completing T4s fast.
- Brings great group support from being able to share <Effect name="Barrier"/> and some boons to targeted players. While also providing some heals through <Trait name="Consume Shadows"/> and <Trait name="Dark Sentry"/>.

<BuildLink build="Condi Specter" specialization="Specter"/>
</Tab>

<Tab title="DPS">

- Currently bulds such as <BuildLink build="Condi Soulbeast" specialization="Soulbeast"/>, <BuildLink build="Condi Virtuoso" specialization="Virtuoso"/>, <BuildLink build="Condi Harbinger" specialization="Harbinger"/>, <BuildLink build="Power Holosmith" specialization="Holosmith"/> (with <Trait name="Pinpoint Distribution"/>) are all strong choices.
- In reality any build (power or condi) works providing it can help meet the concepts listed at the top of the page.

</Tab>
</Tabs>

### <Composition name="Daily Power" composition="Renegade,Firebrand,Dragonhunter,Soulbeast,Soulbeast" roles="Alacrity/CC/DPS,Quickness/CC/DPS,CC/DPS,Frost Spirit/CC/DPS,Spotter/CC/DPS" size="small"/>

This comp is used when parties want to go for some faster boss kills and would like a run requiring more co-ordination. It brings insanely high burst with lots of CC, whilst still being a safe pick for consistent daily clears. In addition although we often chose to play <BuildLink build="Power Dragonhunter" specialization="Dragonhunter"/>, it is very easy to replace with a different class. Classes such as <BuildLink build="Power Weaver" specialization="Weaver"/>, <BuildLink build="Power Berserker" specialization="Berserker"/> and <BuildLink build="Power Holosmith" specialization="Holosmith"/> are all great picks! Read below to see why each class is taken.

<Tabs>
<Tab specialization="Renegade">

- Provides permanent <Boon name="Alacrity"/> and around 10 stacks of <Boon name="Might"/>.

- Provides <Boon name="Stability"/> and projectile destruction on demand (from <Skill name="Legendary Dwarf stance"/> and <Skill name="Legendary Centaur Stance"/> respectively).
- If <Instability name="No Pain, No Gain"/> or <Instability name="Vengeance"/> instability is present it can strip boons with <Skill name="Banish Enchantment"/> (<Skill name="Legendary Demon stance"/>).

<Tab specialization="Firebrand">

- Provides permanent <Boon name="Quickness"/>, on demand <Boon name="Aegis"/> and <Boon name="Resistance"/>.

- Contributes to CC with <Skill name="banesignet"/>, which is also a **unique damage buff** that increases the entire group's power by 216.
- Depending on the fight or if the group is confident. <Specialization name="Guardian"/> or <Specialization name="Dragonhunter"/> can be played resulting in very fast kills.
- Provides instant <Condition name="Vulnerability"/> application with <Skill name="swordofjustice"/>, which helps immensely to kill adds quickly at Mama, Siax and Skorvald.
- Has blinks available from skills such as <Skill name="symbol of blades"/>, <Skill name="judges intervention"/> and <Skill name="mercifulintervention"/>.

| **General Info**  | A very easy to play comp that can faceroll all fractals regardless of instabilities. This is a great option if your group wants to clear fractals safely with little effort. Unless you are an organised consistent static, overall the run time is often the same or faster than playing power. | A solid, consistent power comp providing plenty of CC and group support. This comp is a great start for people looking to run no healer and start to decrease their individual boss kill times. Additionally the <Specialization name="Dragonhunter"/> can be replaced with a different DPS class relatively easily.                                                                                                                  |

| **Pros**          | Lots of sustain and can deal with [ bad Instabilities](/guides/fractal-basics) very easily.<br/><br/>Comp can run pretty much any Condition DPS build and will still work on all fractals.                                                                                                       | Access to an abundant amount of [CC](/guides/cc-distrobution)<br/><br/>Keeping up boons is easy with plenty of sources for <Boon name="Might"/> and plenty of sources to keep <Condition name="Vulnerability"/> at 25 stacks.<br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Cons**          | Some bosses can really start to drag on due to short phases and the time condis take to ramp up.<br/><br/>Condi comps can be quite boring to play if you enjoy optimizing your gameplay and pushing boss times.<br/>                                                                             | The comp is fairly restrictive due to the fact you want two <Specialization name="Soulbeast"/> for <Skill name="One Wolf Pack"/>, meaning only the <Specialization name="Dragonhunter"/> can be replaced easily.<br/><br/>In terms of clear time this comp requires a lot more effort and co-ordination to be faster than running a condi comp. Also requiring you to swap to a condi comp for a quick Ensolyss and 100CM kill. <br/> |
