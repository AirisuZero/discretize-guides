The <Specialization name="Mechanist" text="Heal Alacrity Mechanist" /> provides a permanent amount of <Boon name="Might" />, <Boon name="Alacrity" />, <Boon name="Fury" />, <Boon name="Regeneration" /> and <Boon name="Vigor" /> as well as some <Boon name="Protection" />. It also has access to a small amount of <Boon name="Aegis" />, <Boon name="Stability" /> througt <Skill name="Crisis Zone"/>.

It offers a very good amount of healing thanks to <Skill name="Med Kit"/>, <Skill name="Super Elixir"/>, permanent <Boon name="Regeneration"/> and <Boon name="Vigor"/> that you get from <Skill name="Energizing Slam"/>. Whenever you use a Jade Golem skill it pumps out as well a small amount of healing when traited with <Trait name="Soothing Detonation"/>. You can also provide a huge amount of barrier with <Skill name="Barrier Burst"/>, <Skill name ="Barrier Signet"/> and <Skill name="Barrier Blast"/> making it nearly permanent.

This build also has a lot of CCs but if your shield skills, <Skill name="Personal Battering Ram"/> and <Skill name="Rocket Fist Prototype"/> are not enough you can change <Trait name="Soothing Detonation"/> for <Trait name="Experimental Turrets"/> and take <Skill name="Supply Crate"/> instead of <Skill name="Overclock Signet"/>. If truly desperate, you can also drop <Skill name="Elixir Gun"/> for <Skill name="Thumper Turret"/>.

Note that this build variant is optimized for 150 agony resistance. If you have more Agony Resistance, feel free to swap out more Harrier pieces for Magi but make sure you are maintaining 100% boon duration. You can play full Harrier, however you will lose some <Attribute name="Healing Power"/>. Check the [gear optimizer](https://optimizer.discretize.eu/) for more gear variants!
