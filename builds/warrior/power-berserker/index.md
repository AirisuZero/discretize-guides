    title: Overview
    content: >
      The <Specialization text="Banner Berserker" name="Berserker"/> is the
      strongest build for <Specialization name="Warrior"/> in fractals.


      Besides providing the group with strong unique damage buffs through the stats of <Skill name="Banner of Strength"/> and <Skill name="Banner of Discipline"/> and having excellent defiance bar damage in <Skill name="Tremor"/> and <Skill name="Headbutt"/>, the build also has medium burst and excellent sustained damage. <Specialization name="Warrior"/> can provide half of the necessary <Boon name="Might"/> and <Boon name="Fury"/> to the group by using <Skill name="Forgreatjustice"/>.


      The <Specialization text="Banner Berserker" name="Berserker"/> is one of the classes that benefit a lot from higher agony resistance due to not being able to crit cap by buffs and traits alone.


      Furthermore, the build is able to use damage modifying sigils like <Item name="Impact" type="Sigil"/> as well as slaying potions such as <Item name="Powerful Potion of Slaying Scarlets Armies"/>. As a <Specialization text="Banner Berserker" name="Berserker"/> your focus is to maintain your unique party buffs and instantly contribute to breaking defiance bars, all while making DPS players sweat nervously when they glance at their DPS meter.

      **How to deal damage:**


      - Use <Skill name="decapitate"/> as often as possible. Three crits are required to gain a single <Skill name="decapitate"/>:

        1.  <Skill name="Cycloneaxe"/> and <Skill name="Throw axe" profession="warrior"/>.

        2.  <Skill name="Dualstrike"/> and <Skill name="Throw axe" profession="warrior"/>.

        3.  <Skill name="whirlingaxe"/>.

      - Get three <Skill name="decapitate"/> before pressing <Skill name="Whirling axe"/>.


      - If the boss has a breakbar, make sure to use <Skill name="Tremor"/> to proc <Item name="severance"/>, then swap to Axe/Axe.


      - Only use <Skill name="Throw axe" profession="warrior"/> outside <Skill name="Berserk"/> to prevent its ammo count fully recharging.


      - Interrupting your auto-attack chain to use <Skill name="Decapitate"/> or enter <Skill name="Berserk"/> is a DPS increase.


      - Keep in mind that <Skill name="Crushing Blow"/> inflicts 10x <Condition name="Vulnerability"/> if your party is running low, and can often be used with no DPS loss if you are on your mace set waiting to CC. Especially useful if you apply the <Condition name="Vulnerability"/> to adds for a quick burst.


      - It is important that you are in <Skill name="Berserk"/> mode for as many burn phases as possible for maximum DPS. Pay attention to your group's phase times and your <Skill name="Berserk"/> extensions. It is better for <Skill name="Berserk"/> to drop when the boss isn’t stunned if that means it will be back up right before another burst window.


      - Think ahead when CC is needed and swap to Maces earlier to avoid losing invaluable <Skill name="Berserk"/> time.


      **Extra notes:**


      - If your groups <Boon name="Might"/> is not 25, take <Skill name="Forgreatjustice"/>. It is a bigger DPS increase than <Skill name="signetofmight"/>!


      - If you expect your party to be slow it can make sense to bring <Trait name="smashbrawler"/> and either eat the initial <Control name="Stun"/> of <Skill name="headbutt"/> or break it with <Item id="24"/>.


      - Casting <Skill name="Mending"/> for <Trait name="Peak Performance"/> is only a DPS gain if you can’t be hitting something else, use it right before the start of DPS phases but only use it during if you need the heal.


      - Entering <Skill name="Berserk"/> grants 3 stacks of <Trait name="Berserkers Power"/>, while <Skill name="Decapitate"/> only grants 1. You will find <Trait name="Berserkers Power"/> starting to run low when out of <Skill name="Berserk"/>, try to make sure you are in <Skill name="Berserk"/> for burn phases while also not delaying <Skill name="Berserk"/> where possible.

      |                     |                                |

      | ------------------- | ------------------------------ |

      | <Skill id="14490"/> | 260 damage (while on Mace set) |

      | <Skill id="14556"/> | 200 damage                     |

      | <Skill id="14488"/> | 150 damage                     |

      | <Skill id="14487"/> | 100 damage                     |


      **When to take Maces:**


      - In fights with only one defiance bar, in the beginning, use Mace/Mace.


      - In T4s and encounters that have defiance bars during the fight, use an offhand mace only.

    note: You are an actual mad lad for considering this build. It costs about 3500
      gold... You gain 41 power more over the 222 AR build. It is up to you to
      decide if you want to pay over 80g per extra power. If you want to go full
      Berserker now you will need 304 AR.

<Card title="Information">

Golem rotations out of the raid builds are generally suboptimal in fractals due to <Effect name="Exposed"/> and phases being much shorter compared to raids. The raid rotations are optimized for sustained DPS while in fractals a player needs the ability to adapt a rotation to the amount of time a group needs to finish a phase.\
For that reason you can find a video with openers, that are efficient to use here.
