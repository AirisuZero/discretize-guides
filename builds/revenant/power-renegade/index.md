The <Specialization name="Renegade"/> is one of the professions with the most support and utility. It provides permanent <Boon name="Alacrity"/>, half of the necessary <Boon name="Might"/> with <Skill name="Heroic Command"/>, and if that is not enough already, the <Specialization name="Renegade"/> has also excellent CC capabilities with <Skill name="Surge of the mists"/> and <Skill name="Darkrazorsdaring"/>.

Damage-wise the <Specialization name="Renegade"/> is on the lower end compared to the other damage dealing classes. This does not imply that the damage doesn't matter; in fact <Specialization name="Renegade"/> has a very juicy burst that makes slacking DPS players sweaty.

Since the <Specialization name="Renegade"/> is a power-oriented build it benefits from <Item id="50082"/> and <Item name="Impact" type="Sigil"/>.

To see how the <Specialization name="Renegade"/> is played in Pick Up Groups refer to [Renegade CM guides](https://discretize.eu/cm-guides/revenant/power-renegade/pug/).

<Card title="Information">

Golem rotations out of the raid builds are generally suboptimal in fractals due to <Effect name="Exposed"/> and phases being much shorter compared to raids. The raid rotations are optimized for sustained DPS while in fractals a player needs the ability to adapt a rotation to the amount of time a group needs to finish a phase. For that reason you can find a video with openers, that are efficient to use here.

For more information about advanced rotation and gameplay refer to [Static Renegade CM guides](/cm-guides/revenant/power-renegade/static/).

<Card title="Dealing with No Pain, No Gain">

<Warning>

Note that with a class like <Specialization name="Scourge"/> or <Specialization name="Specter"/> who can strip boons while doing their rotation, you shouldn't have to deal with <Instability name="No Pain, No Gain"/>.
</Warning>

<Grid>

<GridItem xs="12" sm="6">

There are multiple weapons in your arsenal to deal with the instability <Instability name="No Pain, No Gain"/> and make it easier to manage the boons that the enemy will receive from this instability. For fractals with <Instability name="No Pain, No Gain"/> it is recommended to run a staff with <Item id="72872"/> instead of a <Item id="24615"/>. The <Item id="72872"/> will transfer three boons from enemies to you when you interrupt an attack. For enemies with a defiance bar, using a CC skill while the enemy is casting any ability counts as interrupting, even if there is no "_interrupted_" message.

<div style={{marginBottom: "16px"}} />

As for legends that you want to run, the general rule of thumb in groups that perform at least relatively well is to run <Skill name="Legendary Renegade Stance"/> and <Skill name="Legendary Demon Stance"/>. If you find the stability to be an issue on Artsariiv in slower groups where <Skill name="Stand Your Ground"/> isn't enough to cover the <Boon name="Stability"/>, you can run <Skill name="Legendary Dwarf Stance"/> and <Skill name="Legendary Demon Stance"/> or alternatively heavily rely on your <Item id="72872"/> to strip the boons and run <Skill name="Legendary Renegade Stance"/> and <Skill name="Legendary Dwarf Stance"/>. However, this isn't recommended due to the unreliability of <Item id="72872"/>.
