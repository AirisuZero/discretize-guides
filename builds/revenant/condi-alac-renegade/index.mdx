<Warning>

This build is mainly to be used in condition comps. In power comps <BuildLink build="Power Renegade" specialization="Renegade"/> is strictly better due to a lot of factors such as quick burst, more support, and more versatility.

</Warning>

Condi <Specialization name="Renegade"/> is an unique build that may only be played in condition comps, since it performs much better than <BuildLink build="Power Renegade" specialization="Renegade"/>. Condi <Specialization name="Renegade"/> has decent damage output and can be pretty efficient when played properly. Condi <Specialization name="Renegade"/> provides <Boon name="Alacrity"/> and some <Boon name="Might"/> through <Skill id="45537"/> and <Skill id="44076"/> respectively. Finally, to top it off this build has high CC capabilities with <Skill id="41220"/>, <Skill id="28409"/> and <Skill id="41820"/>.

Condi <Specialization name="Renegade"/> is pretty independent due to its rather good mobility (<Skill id="28029"/>, <Skill id="27917"/>) and permanent 25 <Boon name="Might"/> thanks to <Skill id="44076"/> and <Trait id="1781"/>.

<Card title="When to use Order From Above">

- If you use the 80% Boon Duration build use your <Skill id="45537"/> off cooldown
- If you share <Boon name="Alacrity" /> with a <Specialization name="Specter" /> or <Specialization name="Mirage" /> you will need to pay attention to when you will need to share. Depending on their build, you may get away with only pressing <Skill name="ordersfromabove" /> in <Skill name="legendaryrenegadestance" />, but if <Boon name="Alacrity" /> is dropping you will have to press it more regularly.
- If you use the 3rd build (Double Renegade) always use <Skill id="45537"/> during a <Skill id="41858"/> rotation

<Warning>

Do not use <Skill id="45537"/> right before a mechanic or any reason that would not let your whole party get every tick from <Skill id="45537"/> (like spreading around): you are already very tight on <Boon name="Alacrity"/>!

<Card title="Information">

<Specialization name="Renegade" text="Condi Renegade"/>'s raid rotation is not super efficient in fractals due to the lack of time to ramp up with <Skill id="28494"/>, and the fact that you want to save skills you usually use while in <Skill id="41858"/> to CC or keep skills like <Skill name="Citadel Bombardment"/> for exposed phases.

You'll want to respect these rules :

1.  <Skill id="41858"/> : be on Mace/Axe
2.  <Skill id="28494"/> : be on Shortbow

You'll usually want to be in <Skill id="41858"/> for exposed phases, as <Skill name="Citadel Bombardment"/> is your best skill to damage quickly thanks to <Condition name="Burning"/>. You also want to be on <Skill id="41858"/> to be able to precast <Skill id="42949"/> for <Condition name="Bleeding"/>, and use <Skill id="41220"/> and <Skill name="Temporal Rift"/> to CC.

Right after you're done with <Skill id="41858"/> skills, swap to <Skill id="28494"/> and do the Shortbow Rotation shown below.

You will want to use <Skill id="45537"/> and <Skill name="Heroic Command"/> off cooldown/at key moments. If <Skill id="45537"/> will be off cooldown during a <Skill id="28494"/> Rotation, stop <Skill name="Embrace The Darkness"/> right before **Step 9**. If it will be off cooldown during a <Skill id="41858"/> Rotation, don't use <Skill id="40485"/>.

<Card title="Precasting">

1.  If you can get in combat prestack <Item id="24609"/>
2.  <Skill name="ordersfromabove" />
3.  Blast <Boon name="Might" /> with <Skill name="echoingeruption" /> or <Skill name="renewingwave" />
4.  Take _Mistlock Singularity_
5.  <Skill name="ordersfromabove" />
6.  Blast <Boon name="Might" /> with <Skill name="echoingeruption" /> or <Skill name="renewingwave" />
7.  Swap to <Skill name="legendaryassassinstance" /> and cast <Skill name="enchanteddaggers" />
8.  Swap back to <Skill name="legendaryrenegadestance" />.
    In [Sunqua Peak](/fractals/sunqua-peak) boons get stripped but unique buffs don't, and you can play around the boon-stripping.

9.  If you can get in combat prestack <Item id="24609"/>
10. Be in <Skill name="legendaryassassinstance" /> and cast <Skill id="26937"/>
11. <Skill id="45537"/>
12. _UI Swap_ to <Skill id="28494"/>
13. Take the _Mistlock Singularity_

- If your group is fast enough you'll get some <Skill id="45537"/> ticks in combat, and the <Boon name="Alacrity"/> from those ticks won't get stripped.
