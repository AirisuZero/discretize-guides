The **<Specialization text="Celestial Firebrand" name="Firebrand"/>** is a build for groups to use instead of a **<Specialization text="Heal Firebrand" name="Firebrand"/>**. It provides more than enough healing for most groups, permanent <Boon name="Quickness"/>, a large chunk (15-18 stacks) of <Boon name="might"/> and on demand <Boon name="Stability"/> and <Boon name="Aegis"/>, whilst dealing a decent amount of damage. It is especially strong in PuGs where often a **<Specialization text="Heal Firebrand" name="Firebrand"/>** is overkill, especially in condi groups, but the convenience of having a more supportive player pumping out important boons such as <Boon name="might"/>, <Boon name="Stability"/>, <Boon name="Aegis"/> and heals is invaluable.

The general idea of these builds is to leverage the Celestial stat combo (<Attribute name="Power"/>, <Attribute name="Precision"/>, <Attribute name="Toughness"/>, <Attribute name="Vitality"/>, <Attribute name="Ferocity"/>,<br/> <Attribute name="Healing Power"/>, <Attribute name="Condition Damage"/>, <Attribute name="Concentration"/>, <Attribute name="Expertise"/>) and the Seraph stat combo (<Attribute name="Precision"/>, <Attribute name="Healing Power"/>, <Attribute name="Condition Damage"/> and <Attribute name="Concentration"/>). This gives a high amount of <Attribute name="Healing Power"/> and <Attribute name="Condition Damage"/>. They then uses Runes, Sigils and Food to cap <Condition name="Burning"/> duration allowing you to deal a good amount of damage.

There are Three variants shown below; a low AR Celestial variant, a high AR Celestial variant, and a Celestial Heal variant. The Celestial 150AR variant is the standard version with high boon duration and provides solid damage while being fairly forgiving with boon uptimes. It also has the advantage of working well in other content outside of fractals with minimal changes. The Celestial 222AR build is a more offensive build and offers the most damage. While the Celestial Heal 150AR variant is much more supportive and a last resort before swapping to <BuildLink build="Heal Firebrand" specialization="Firebrand"/>. All of these builds can be optimized further with a mix of gear to suit your needs using our [gear optimizer](https://optimizer.discretize.eu/).

<Warning>
There are several different gear, utility, and trait setups that allow you to maintain quickness that can be situationally chosen. Check the [gear optimizer](https://optimizer.discretize.eu/) to adjust your gear for the boon durations listed below:

- <Trait name="Liberators Vow"/>, <Trait name="Legendary Lore"/>, <Skill name="Mantra of Solace"/>, <Skill name="Mantra of Potence"/> (using all charges) - 60.5%bd
- <Trait name="Liberators Vow"/>, <Trait name="Legendary Lore"/>, <Skill name="Mantra of Solace"/>, <Skill name="Mantra of Potence"/> (saving last charge) and <Skill name="Feel My Wrath"/> - 69.8%bd
- <Trait name="Liberators Vow"/>, <Trait name="Legendary Lore"/>, <Skill name="Mantra of Solace"/>, <Skill name="Mantra of Potence"/> (using all charges) and <Skill name="Feel My Wrath"/> - 32.5%bd

**This build has much higher <Attribute name="Healing Power"/> and Outgoing Healing, with the trade-off being it deals less damage. This variant is more suited to use in groups who are less confident and require more support or if you want to have more of a safety net to carry your party. It can also be used in other game modes.**

<Card title="Common Gear Adjustments">

As you will have seen from the equipment, Celestial/Seraph Firebrand has many variations you can use to adapt to your needs. Here is a brief overview of the common Attribute types, Runes, Sigils, and Consumables that are used when gearing Celestial and Seraph variants. As mentioned above you can use our [gear optimizer](https://optimizer.discretize.eu/) to help calculate what gear will be best, but in general, remember you want to aim for 100% <Condition name="Burning"/> duration and at least 69% <Boon name="Quickness"/> duration to allow you to play <Trait name="Legendary Lore"/> in Fractals (although the higher you can get your <Attribute name="Concentration"/> the easier time you will have to maintain boons)!

Keeping up <Boon name="Quickness"/> is a lot easier than with a <BuildLink build="Condi Firebrand" specialization="Firebrand"/> thanks to the increased <Attribute name="Boon Duration"/>. Nevertheless, it has less room for errors compared to <BuildLink build="Heal Firebrand" specialization="Firebrand"/>! General guidelines for keeping up <Boon name="Quickness"/>:

- Use <Skill name="Feel My Wrath"/> whenever ready.
- Use all charges of <Skill name="Mantra of Potence"/> off cooldown and <Skill name="Mantra of Solace"/> every 7 seconds due to the cooldown of <Trait name="Liberators Vow"/>
- Only use these skills close to your allies - try to "puke" on them with the mantras
- Keep in mind that equipping/stowing a tome grants you (only you, not your party members!) 3 seconds of <Boon name="Quickness"/> every 8 seconds thanks to <Trait name="swift scholar"/>!

<Warning>

To play <Trait name="Legendary Lore"/> in Fractals you need to have at least 60% boon duration to upkeep <Boon name="Quickness"/>. Both the Seraph and the Celestial builds have 40% from gear. meaning you will need to get the rest from agony resistance and consumables. If you cannot get enough boon duration to be safe just play with <Trait name="Weighty Terms"/>!

Please note the minimum suggested boon duration is influenced by prestacking and typically short phases. It is recommended to get as much Boon Duration as you can for an easier time maintaining boons! Outside of fractals, you need at least 70% Boon Duration to play <Trait name="Legendary Lore"/>.
</Warning>

The rotation is a **lot** simpler compared to any other <Specialization name="Guardian"/> build (except for HFB where your weapons do not have an immediate effect on how efficient the build is). However, weapon swaps require careful consideration, because it is not efficient to be stuck on staff or to have less than 25 <Boon name="might"/> during a damage phase.
Getting the weapon swaps right is probably the hardest part (more info below). Generally, it is recommended to always camp Axe/Torch and only swap to staff to use <Skill name="Empower"/> to top up <Boon name="Might"/>.

**General information:**

- On Axe/Torch:
  - Use <Skill name="Symbol of Vengeance"/>
  - Use <Skill name="Zealots Flame"/> into <Skill name="Zealots Fire"/>
  - Use <Skill name="Cleansing Flame"/>
  - Try not to interrupt your auto-attack chain
  - Make sure to have <Skill name="Blazing Edge"/> ready for when you need to CC or need to pull in any adds.
- In <Skill name="Tome of Justice"/>:
  - Your standard DPS rotation is <Skill name="Epilogue: Ashes of the Just"/>, <Skill name="Chapter 4: Scorched Aftermath"/>, <Skill name="Chapter 2: Igniting Burst"/>.
  - Don't be afraid to replace <Skill name="Chapter 2: Igniting Burst"/>, with <Skill name="Chapter 3: Heated Rebuke"/> for more CC or to pull any adds.
- On Staff:
  - Use <Skill name="Empower"/>
  - Blast fire fields with <Skill name="holystrike"/>. If there is no fire field you can put one down with tome1-4
  - Use <Skill name="Symbol of Swiftness"/>
- Apart from that:
  - <Skill name="Sanctuary"/> or <Skill name="Hammer of Wisdom"/> to break defiance bars.
  - Remember to be smart about your free utility swap and adjust as necessary to the encounter and your party.

Suggested key moments to swap to staff and <Skill name="Empower"/>:

- **MAMA**: There is no exact key moment and you need to decide on your own when to swap to staff.
- **Siax**: This build has quite good damage and is fairly self-sustained enabling you to kill your add quickly. Swap to staff for the last few percent and be ready to <Skill name="Empower"/> in the middle. This works better the slower the group is due to the weapon swap cooldown. If another person helps you kill your add (typically the <Specialization name="Renegade"/>) you can chill on staff for the add so you are ready to swap to Axe/Torch sooner.
- **Enso**: Be on staff at the beginning of every phase and use <Skill name="Empower"/> while Ensolyss is invulnerable.
- **Skorvald**: Anomalies 2 and 4. In case your group gets too fast you might have to skip <Skill name="Empower"/> at the 2nd island. When using the 66% portal make sure to drop a <Skill name="Symbol of Swiftness"/> on Skorvald before swapping to Axe/Torch.
- **Artsariiv**: If your party deals the majority of its damage in the middle you want to empower at 66% and 33% shortly before she becomes vulnerable. If not, you may empower while she is jumping away and the team kills the Anomaly.
- **Arkk**: Finish your orb first by camping in the light field and auto-attacking with the superior weapon (staff) so you can precast <Skill name="Empower"/> and <Skill name="Symbol of Swiftness"/>.
- **Ai**: On light Ai you will want to <Skill name="Empower"/> mid at the beginning of the fight and after each split phase. You should also swap to Staff during the split mechanic so you can cast <Skill name="Empower"/> as everyone returns to the middle. On Dark Ai this is mostly the same aside from the lack of split phases so keep an eye on <Boon name="might"/> and be ready to swap to Staff when needed. Remember with the amount of movement in this fight to be casting <Skill name="Symbol of Swiftness"/> where possible to help keep everyone moving.

Tomes are very useful when no other skills are ready. <Skill name="Tome of Justice"/> also gets refreshed every time an enemy dies (works with anomalies at Skorvald/Artsariiv/Arkk, knights at MAMA, and hallucinations at Siax).

<Skill name="Tome of Courage"/> and <Skill name="Tome of Resolve"/> are great for high incoming damage scenarios.

<Skill name="Tome of Resolve" />:

- Use this Tome for emergency healing and cleansing.
- <Skill name="Chapter 1: Desert Bloom"/> heals in a cone in front of you.
- <Skill name="Chapter 2: Radiant Recovery"/> heals and cleanses conditions.
- <Skill name="Chapter 3: Azure Sun"/> gives some boons but will rarely be used.
- <Skill name="Chapter 4: Shining River"/> places a healing field that can also be blasted for extra healing.
- <Skill name="Epilogue: Eternal Oasis"/> converts conditions into boons and grants allies an incoming healing modifier.
- When running Virtues entering this Tome also cleanses conditions.
- Common rotations in this Tome are 2-5-4-1-2 for maximum sustained healing or 5-4-2-1-1 for maximum burst healing.

<Skill name="Tome of Courage" />:

- Use this Tome for massive <Boon name="Stability"/>, <Boon name="Resistance"/> or a reflect.
- <Skill name="Chapter 1: Unflinching Charge"/> grants <Boon name="Stability"/>.
- <Skill name="Chapter 2: Daring Challenge"/> inflicts 1 second of <Condition name="Taunt"/> on the enemy which is a 75/s soft CC.
- <Skill name="Chapter 3: Valiant Bulwark"/> places a bubble that reflects incoming projectiles.
- <Skill name="Chapter 4: Stalwart Stand"/> places a field that pulses <Boon name="Resistance"/> to allies. This will help dealing with non-damaging conditions such as <Condition name="Blinded"/> and <Condition name="Slow"/>.
- <Skill name="Epilogue: Unbroken Lines"/> provides <Boon name="Protection"/>, <Boon name="Aegis"/>, <Boon name="Stability"/> as well as extra Toughness.
- There is no set rotation in this Tome, use whatever skills you need for their utility and make sure to press Skill 5 as it is an incredibly strong skill.
- You can camp in this Tome for a few extra seconds to get an extra cast on an important skill, for example, a 2nd reflect. However, only do this when needed as you will not have access to the boons and healing your weapon skills provide.
