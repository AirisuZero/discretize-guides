<Beginner>

The **<Specialization text="Condi Firebrand" name="Firebrand"/>** is a self-sufficient DPS build, which is not entirely relying on support from the party. This is achieved by bringing slightly more than 50% <Boon name="Quickness" /> to the party. Further, this build brings <Boon name="Stability"/> for the team. Don't be fooled though; the DPS sacrifice is neglectable so that the <Specialization text="Condi Firebrand" name="Firebrand"/> maintains consistent very high DPS. In addition to that, a free utility slot allows the <Specialization text="Condi Firebrand" name="Firebrand"/> to adapt to almost any situation and fill the parties needs ideally.

The beginner version should not be played in the slot of a <Boon name="Quickness" />-provider. Instead, it is a fully fledged DPS class! The added <Boon name="Quickness" /> will help to cover potential gaps in <Boon name="Quickness"/> application and alleviate some of stress the <Boon name="Quickness" />-provider might face.

This is a great build to get started in fractals as you provide a base amount of supportive utilty. As you progress through fractals and discover new depths of the immersive gameplay of Guild Wars 2, you can tweak this build more and more. Before reading the advanced version of this page, we recommend to acquire an in depth understanding of your CC skills and when to use them efficiently. You also should be able to hit more than 45% <Boon name="Quickness"/> uptime (measure this with the [arc-dps](https://www.deltaconnected.com/arcdps/) boon table [addon](https://github.com/knoxfighter/GW2-ArcDPS-Boon-Table)). And finally, you should be able to execute the basic step-by-step rotation provided below without spending too much thought on it.

The advanced page provides a more complete overview over all the utility the <Specialization name="Guardian"/> has to offer. If you ever feel like you are missing information feel free to already swap to the advanced page!

<Information>

Although this build lists 162 <Attribute name="Agony Resistance"/>, it is not a strict requirement! We recommend to get started with this build anyway - even if it might be suboptimal while being in Tier 1 or 2 fractals. Keep upgrading your <Attribute name="Agony Resistance"/> until you reach the suggested variant. In the beginning it is much more important to learn about fractal mechanics and your skills rather than equipping optimal gear.

</Information>

</Beginner>

<Advanced>

The **<Specialization text="Condi Firebrand" name="Firebrand"/>** can provide permanent <Boon name="Quickness"/> (if necessary) to the party while dealing high consistent DPS. Your tomes are by far your most important skills; they enable you to do great DPS as well as support and heal your allies. Tomes cover almost the entire toolbox of defensive capabilities such as boons like <Boon name="Stability"/>, <Boon name="Resistance"/>, but also reflects and pulls and condi cleanses. Knowing where to find these defensive skills is an important part of supporting your team as a DPS player.

This build has tremendous amounts of self-sustain and is therefore also a great build for soloing content:

- Permanent <Boon name="Quickness"/>.
- Some <Boon name="Might"/> uptime.
- <Skill id="41780"/> for heals.
- <Skill id="42259"/> for <Boon name="Stability"/>, <Boon name="Resistance"/>, reflects and damage reduction.
- Optionally: <Skill name="litanyofwrath"/> for a 6s long high HP regeneration.

Overall this build is one of the best picks for newer players, for PuGs as <Boon name="Quickness"/> provider or for people that want to be more independent of their groups.

<Warning>

There are a number of different gear, utility and trait setups that allow you to maintain quickness that can be situationally chosen. Check the [gear optimizer](https://optimizer.discretize.eu/) to adjust your gear for the boon durations listed below:

- <Trait name="Liberators Vow"/>, <Trait name="Weighty Terms"/>, <Skill name="Mantra of Solace"/>, <Skill name="Mantra of Potence"/> and <Skill name="Feel My Wrath"/> - 41.7%bd
- <Trait name="Liberators Vow"/>, <Trait name="Legendary Lore"/>, <Skill name="Mantra of Solace"/>, <Skill name="Mantra of Potence"/> and <Skill name="Feel My Wrath"/> - 69.8%bd

Check the [gear optimizer](https://optimizer.discretize.eu/) to adjust your gear if you need to take extra boon duration.

You will want the following weapons to swap to during fractal runs:

- Greatsword for pulling adds in Nightmare CM after MAMA and some T4s
- A staff for <Boon name="Might"/> pre-stacking.
- If you have low might uptime you can change <Item id="48911"/> to <Item id="24562"/>.

Check the [gear optimizer](https://optimizer.discretize.eu/) to adjust your gear if you need to take extra boon duration.

This setup is the same as the Raid/Strike <Specialization name="Firebrand" text="Condi Quickbrand"/> build. The only difference is due to the extra <Attribute name="boon duration"/> gained from <Item id="75427"/>, you can safely run <Trait name="Legendary Lore"/> for more damage. While it deals a bit less damage than the <Item id="24765"/> builds, it allows you to use the same build in multiple areas of the game.

If you have short phases and are confident maintaing <Boon name="Quickness"/>, <Instability name="Boon Overload"/> or you have over 195 <Attribute name="Agony Resistance"/>, you can use <Item id="48917"/>.

You will want the following weapons to swap to during fractal runs:

- Greatsword for pulling adds in Nightmare CM after MAMA and some T4s
- A staff for <Boon name="Might"/> pre-stacking.
- If you have low might uptime you can change <Item id="48911"/> to <Item id="24562"/>.

To keep up <Boon name="Quickness"/>:

- Use <Skill name="Feel My Wrath"/> whenever ready
- Use <Skill name=" mantraofsolace"/> and <Skill name="mantraofpotence"/>. Keep in mind that <Skill name="mantraofsolace"/> does <Boon name="Quickness"/> only every seven seconds (<Trait name="liberatorsvow"/>)!
- Only use these skills close to your allies - try to "puke" on them with the mantras
- Keep in mind that equipping or stowing a tome grants you 3 seconds of <Boon name="Quickness"/> every 8 seconds thanks to <Trait name="swift scholar"/>!

Tomes are very useful when no other skills are ready. <Skill name="Tome of Justice"/> also gets refreshed every time an enemy dies (works with anomalies at Skorvald/Artsariiv/Arkk, knights at MAMA and hallucinations at Siax).

The <Skill name="Tome of Courage"/> and <Skill name="Tome of Resolve"/> are great for high incoming damage scenarios.

<Skill name="Tome of Resolve" />:

- Use this Tome for emergency healing and cleansing.
- <MissingSkill name="Chapter 1: Desert Bloom"/> heals in a cone in front of you.
- <MissingSkill name="Chapter 2: Radiant Recovery"/> heals and cleanses conditions.
- <MissingSkill name="Chapter 3: Azure Sun"/> gives some boons but will rarely be used.
- <MissingSkill name="Chapter 4: Shining River"/> places a healing field that can also be blasted for extra healing.
- <MissingSkill name="Epilogue: Eternal Oasis"/> converts conditions into boons and grants allies an incoming healing modifier.
- When running Virtues entering this Tome also cleanses conditions.
- Common rotations in this Tome are 2-5-4-1-2 for maximum sustained healing or 5-4-2-1-1 for maximum burst healing.

<Skill name="Tome of Courage" />:

- Use this Tome for massive <Boon name="Stability"/>, <Boon name="Resistance"/> or a reflect.
- <MissingSkill name="Chapter 1: Unflinching Charge"/> grants <Boon name="Stability"/>.
- <MissingSkill name="Chapter 2: Daring Challenge"/> inflicts 1 second of <Condition name="Taunt"/> on the enemy which is a 75/s soft CC.
- <MissingSkill name="Chapter 3: Valiant Bulwark"/> places a bubble that reflects incoming projectiles.
- <MissingSkill name="Chapter 4: Stalwart Stand"/> places a field that pulses <Boon name="Resistance"/> to allies. This will help dealing with non-damaging conditions such as <Condition name="Blinded"/> and <Condition name="Slow"/>.
- <MissingSkill name="Epilogue: Unbroken Lines"/> provides <Boon name="Protection"/>, <Boon name="Aegis"/>, <Boon name="Stability"/> as well as extra Toughness.
- There is no set rotation in this Tome, use whatever skills you need for their utility and make sure to press Skill 5 as it is an incredibly strong skill.
- You can camp in this Tome for a few extra seconds to get an extra cast on an important skill, for example a 2nd reflect. However only do this when absolutely needed as you will not have access to the boons and healing your weapon skills provide.

<Warning>

**Make sure to only press <Skill id="9089"/> three times (twice to throw the projectile and once to activate the skill initially) or you will cancel a wasted cast! Never interrupt your axe auto attack chain! Keep <Skill name="purgingflames"/> on cooldown!**

1.  <Skill name="purgingflames"/>
2.  <Skill id="9104"/> (Torch 4)

When <Skill name="Tome of Justice"/> is off cd you just repeat this rotation.
</Card>
</Advanced>

<Beginner>
<Card title="Step-by-Step Rotation">

**Step 1: Quickness**

- Use 1 charge of <Skill name="Mantra of Solace"/> and all charges of <Skill name="Mantra of Potence"/>.
- Whenever a charge comes back, use both Mantras once again. Keep <Skill name="Mantra of Potence"/> at 0 charges and <Skill name="Mantra of Solace"/> at 2 charges for when you need healing. You can cast these while casting other skills as they are instant-casts.
- Note: Using <Skill name="Mantra of Solace"/> more often than every 7 seconds will not result in more <Boon name="Quickness"/> due to the cooldown of <Trait name="Liberator's Vow"/>.

**Step 2: Basic Skills**

Start by using the following 3 skills off-cooldown in this order of priority:

1. <Skill name="Purging Flames"/>
2. <Skill name="Symbol of Vengeance"/>
3. <Skill name="Blazing Edge"/>

**Step 3: F1 Tome**

Whenever your <Skill name="Tome of Justice"/> is up, enter it and do the following rotation:

1. <MissingSkill name="Chapter 2: Ignite Burst"/>
2. <MissingSkill name="Chapter 4: Scorched Aftermath"/>
3. <MissingSkill name="Epilogue: Ashes of the Just"/>
4. <MissingSkill name="Chapter 1: Searing Spell"/>
5. <MissingSkill name="Chapter 2: Ignite Burst"/>

**Step 4: Torch 4**

Lastly, add <Skill name="Zealots Flame"/> to your rotation.

- If you press <Skill name="Zealots Flame"/>, you will gain a stack of <Skill name="Zealots Fire"/> that you can throw at your enemy.
- <Trait name="Radiant fire"/> will give you an additional <Skill name="Zealots Fire"/> every 10 seconds.
- Once you have 2 charges, throw both of them.

Note: Unless you execute the rotation perfectly, this will eventually de-sync. Once this happens, just use both the <Skill name="Zealots Fire"/> you get from <Trait name="Radiant fire"/> and <Skill name="Zealots Flame"/> off-cooldown.

</Card>

<Card title="Improving Further">

Once you are comfortable with the above steps, you are already doing most of the full rotation and will be able to deal great damage.

There will be a few additional things on the advanced page to improve further but if you got to here, you already know the most important things and these will have less total impact that what you learned so far.

The additional steps are:

- Before opening your damage tome <Skill name="Tome of Justice"/>, swap to scepter and drop a <Skill name="Symbol of Punishment"/> (Sc2).
- Do not auto-attack while on scepter. Scepter auto-attacks are your weakest skills. Instead fill the gaps with <Skill name="Cleansing Flame"/> (Torch 5) and <Skill name="Zealots Flame"/> (Torch 4).
- Drop a final <Skill name="Symbol of Punishment"/> before swapping back to axe.

<Card title="Precasting">

<Warning>

The most important part is to get the precast of Ashes of the Just right! You have to start the fight quickly to not lose the stacks since they only last 10 seconds!
</Warning>

1.  Use <Skill name="hallowedground"/>
2.  Blast a fire field with <Skill name="holystrike"/> and/or <Skill name="Hammer of Wisdom"/>
3.  While casting: Use 3 charges of <Skill name="mantraofpotence"/> and share <Skill name="mantraofsolace"/> (keep in mind that <Skill name="mantraofsolace"/> only shares <Boon name="Quickness"/> once every 7 seconds thanks to <Trait name=" liberators vow"/>)
4.  Use <Skill name="Feelmywrath"/>
5.  Open <Skill id="44364"/> and use <MissingSkill name="Epilogue: Ashes of the Just"/>
6.  Take the _Mistlock Singularity_
7.  Use <Skill name="Feelmywrath"/> again
