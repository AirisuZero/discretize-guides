The <Specialization name="Willbender" text="Condi Willbender"/> is a strong build with high damage, very good CC, and great mobility, making it a strong choice for all groups. It can also easily slot more supportive utility skills allowing you to provide <Boon name="Stability"/>, <Boon name="Aegis"/>, reflects and more to yourself and your party.

<Advanced>

Compared to the <Specialization name="Firebrand" text="Condi Firebrand"/>, this build has even greater self-sustain and can provide a large amount of <Boon name="Might" /> for itself if needed by taking <Trait name="holyreckoning" />. It can also provide more CC due to <Skill name="heavenspalm" />. However, it lacks the utility the Tomes can provide as well as the option to bring a significant amount of <Boon name="Quickness" />.

</Advanced>

<Beginner>

This build comes with a very simple priority-based rotation as well as the ability to adapt to your group by having various utility options. It also has a great amount of self-sustain and can even bring <Boon name="Might" /> for itself if needed through <Trait name="holyreckoning" />. It is therefore a great build to get started within fractals. On top of this, it also shares gear with the <Specialization name="Firebrand" text="Condi Firebrand"/> allowing you to easily swap between the 2 builds if you want more variety or situationally use some of the utility that is unique to <Specialization name="Firebrand"/>.

Before reading the advanced version of this page, we recommend acquiring an in-depth understanding of your CC skills and when to use them efficiently as well as executing the basic step-by-step rotation provided below without spending too much thought on it.

The advanced page provides a more complete overview of all the utilities the <Specialization name="Guardian"/> has to offer. If you ever feel like you are missing information feel free to already swap to the advanced page!

<Information>

Although this build lists 162 <Attribute name="Agony Resistance"/>, it is not a strict requirement! We recommend getting started with this build anyway - even if it might be suboptimal while being in Tier 1 or 2 fractals. Keep upgrading your <Attribute name="Agony Resistance"/> until you reach the suggested variant. In the beginning, it is much more important to learn about fractal mechanics and your skills rather than equipping optimal gear.

Many different gear variations can be run on this build that varies damage-wise in certain situations. Overall when considering <Effect name="Exposed"/> and the fact you can share gear with <Specialization name="Firebrand" text ="Condi Firebrand"/> makes the setup below the best option for fractals. If you want to optimize for different situations you can use our [gear optimizer](https://optimizer.discretize.eu/).

In general for fractals there is no set rotation for <Specialization name="Willbender" text="Condi Willbender"/>. Instead, you want to adapt your rotation depending on phase length and cooldowns. You can use the skill priority list below to see what your most important skills are. In general though make sure to prioritise using <Skill name="Rushing Justice"/> to maintain <Skill id="62618"/> and aim for maximum uptime of <Trait name="lethal tempo"/>.

1. <Skill name="Rushing Justice"/>
2. <Skill name="Purging Flames"/>
3. <Skill name="Symbol of Punishment"/>

You can also precast stacks of <Trait name="lethal tempo"/> using your virtue skills, but this can be tricky due to them being movement abilities.
</Card>
</Advanced>

<Beginner>

<Card title="Step-by-Step Rotation">

**Step 1: Basic Priority**

The <Specialization text="Condition Willbender" name="Willbender"/> has a rather simple, mostly priority-based rotation. In the first step, we will use 4 basic abilities off-cooldown in the following order of priority:

1. <Skill name="Rushing Justice"/>
2. <Skill name="Purging Flames"/>
3. <Skill name="Symbol of Punishment"/>
4. <Skill name="Whirling Light"/>

Use these skills in this order once at the start, then use them off-cooldown with the same priority if multiple come up at the same time. The hardest part of this should be the opening where all 4 skills are up at the same time.

**Step 2: Torch 4**

<Skill name="Zealots Flame"/> is the most intricate skill we will use in this rotation. If you want a visual example of how it is used based on the text below, check out one of the videos on the right side.

Using <Skill name="Zealots Flame"/> will give a stack of <Skill name="Zealots Fire"/> that we can then throw at the target.

- <Trait name="Radiant Fire"/> will give an additional <Skill name="Zealots Fire"/> once every 10 seconds.
- Since we have a few seconds to throw the <Skill name="Zealots Fire"/>, we can use this time to press other priority skills first if any are up.

We will use this skill in the following way:

- In the opening, we will press <Skill name="Zealots Flame"/> while casting the first skill. We will then gain an additional stack from <Trait name="Radiant Fire"/>. After using the priority skills from step 1, we can throw both stacks at the target.
- You can also throw the <Skill name="Zealots Fire"/> before casting <Skill name="Whirling Light"/>.
- After the opening, we will cast <Skill name="Zealots Flame"/> off-cooldown and throw <Skill name="Zealots Fire"/> (from both sources) as soon as possible, only delaying it slightly if another priority skill is up.
- After the opening, the 2 stacks of <Skill name="Zealots Fire"/> will often not align anymore due to <Trait name="Restorative Virtues"/> reducing our weapon cooldown, but not the trait cooldown.

**Step 3: Torch 5**

Finally, we will add <Skill name="Cleansing Flame"/> into the rotation. This skill has a very long channel (approx. 2.5 seconds) and has less of a priority than the other skills we have used so far.

Therefore we will only use this skill when there is at least a 2.5-second gap between other abilities so we do not delay anything more important. Ideally, there should never be another priority skill coming off-cooldown in the middle of the cast of <Skill name="Cleansing Flame"/> if used correctly.

</Card>

<Card title="Improving Further">

Once you are comfortable with the above steps, you are already doing most of the full rotation and will be able to deal great damage.

There will be a few additional things on the advanced page to improve further but if you got here, you already know the most important things and these will have a smaller impact than what you learned so far.

There is only one additional step (besides learning the rest of the utility you can situationally bring):

- Incorporating the Sword weapon set into the rotation. There, we will prioritize <Skill name="Symbol of Blades"/> over <Skill name="Zealots Defense"/>.
- For the most part, the idea is to use the <Skill name="Symbol of Blades"/>/<Skill name="Zealots Defense"/> and <Skill name="Symbol of Punishment"/> twice on the respective weapon set.
