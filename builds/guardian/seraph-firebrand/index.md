The **<Specialization text="Seraph Firebrand" name="Firebrand"/>** is a build for groups to use instead of a **<Specialization text="Heal Firebrand" name="Firebrand"/>**. It provides more than enough healing for most groups, permanent <Boon name="Quickness"/>, a large chunk (15-18 stacks) of <Boon name="might"/> and on demand <Boon name="Stability"/> and <Boon name="Aegis"/>, whilst dealing a decent amount of damage. It is especially strong in PuGs where often a **<Specialization text="Heal Firebrand" name="Firebrand"/>** is overkill, especially in condi groups, but the convenience of having a more supportive player pumping out important boons such as <Boon name="might"/>, <Boon name="Stability"/>, <Boon name="Aegis"/> and heals is invaluable.

<Divider text="Equipment"/>

The general idea of this build is to leverage the Seraph stat combo (<Attribute name="Precision"/>, <Attribute name="Healing Power"/>, <Attribute name="Condition Damage"/> and <Attribute name="Concentration"/>). This gives a high amount of <Attribute name="Healing Power"/> and <Attribute name="Condition Damage"/>. It then uses Runes, Sigils and Food to cap <Condition name="Burning"/> duration allowing you to deal a good amount of damage. There are three variants shown below; a Seraph variant, Celestial variant and a Celestial Heal variant. The Seraph Variant is a more offensive build and offers the most damage. The Celestial variant is slightly less damage but also a better option if playing outside of fractals. While the Celestial Heal variant is much more supportive and a last resort before swapping to <BuildLink build="Heal Firebrand" specialization="Firebrand"/> . All of these builds can be optimised further with a mix of gear to suit your needs using our [gear optimizer](http://old.discretize.eu).

<Tab title="Seraph Variant">
**This is the standard build variant. It provides higher damage then the Celestial build in fractals whilst still providing more than enough support for most groups.**

**This build bursts less than the Seraph variant but over time in long phases it deals slightly more damage. If you intend to play the build outside of fractals also this is a better build to use than Seraph.

Keeping up <Boon name="Quickness"/> is a lot easier than with a <BuildLink build="Condi Firebrand" specialization="Firebrand"/> thanks to the increased <Attribute name="Boon Duration"/>. Nevertheless, it has less room for errors compared to <BuildLink build="Heal Firebrand" specialization="Firebrand"/>! General guidelines for keeping up <Boon name="Quickness"/>:

- Use <Skill name="Feel My Wrath"/> whenever ready.
- Use <Skill name="Mantra of Potence"/> off cooldown and <Skill name="Mantra of Solace"/> every 7 seconds due to the cooldown of <Trait name="Liberators Vow"/>
- Only use these skills close to your allies - try to "puke" on them with the mantras
- Keep in mind that equipping/stowing a tome grants you (only you, not your party members!) 3 seconds of <Boon name="Quickness"/> every 8 seconds thanks to <Trait name="swift scholar"/>!

<Message>
To play <Trait name="Legendary Lore"/> you need to have at least 60% boon duration to upkeep <Boon name="Quickness"/>. Both the Seraph and the Celestial builds have 40% from gear. meaning you will need to get the rest from agony resistance and consumables. If you cannot get enough boon duration to be safe just play with <Trait name="Stalwart Speed"/>!
</Message>

The rotation is a **lot** simpler compared to any other <Specialization name="Guardian"/> build (except for hfb where your weapons do not have immediate effect on how efficient the build is). However, weapon swaps require careful consideration, because it is not efficient to be stuck on staff or to have less than 25 <Boon name="might"/> during a damage phase.  
Getting the weapon swaps right is probably the hardest part (more info below). Generally, it is recommended to always camp Axe/Torch and only swap to staff to use <Skill name="Empower"/> to top up <Boon name="Might"/>.

**General information:**

- On Axe/Torch:
  - Use <Skill name="Symbol of Vengeance"/>
  - Use <Skill name="Zealots Flame"/> into <Skill name="Zealots Fire"/>
  - Use <Skill name="Cleansing Flame"/>
  - Try not to interupt you auto attack chain
  - Make sure to have <Skill name="Blazing Edge"/> ready for when you need to CC or need to pull in any adds.
- In <Skill name="Tome of Justice"/>:
  - Your standard DPS rotation is Chapter 2: Igniting Burst (F1-2), Chapter 4: Scorched Aftermath (F1-4), Epilogue: Ashes of the Just (F1-5), Chapter 1: Searing Spell (F1-1), Igniting Burst (F1-2).
  - Dont be afraid to replace a skill, preferably Chapter 1: Searing Spell (F1-1) or Chapter 2: Igniting Burst (F1-2), with Chapter 3: Heated Rebuke (F1-3) for more CC or to pull any adds.
- On Staff:
  - Use <Skill name="Empower"/>
  - Blast fire fields with <Skill name="holystrike"/>. If there is no fire field you can put one down with tome1-4
  - Use <Skill name="Symbol of Swiftness"/>
- Apart from that:
  - <Skill name="Sanctuary"/> or <Skill name="Bane Signet"/> to break defiance bars. Using <Skill name="Bane Signet"/> to provide the group with a temporary 216 <Attribute name="Power"/> buff (Should also be used when there is no defiance bar ready but it will be off cooldown for the next phase).
  - Remember to be smart about your free utility swap and adjust as necessary to the encounter and your party.

Suggested key moments to swap to staff and <Skill name="Empower"/>:

- **MAMA**: There is no exact key moment and you need to decide on your own when to swap to staff.
- **Siax**: This build has quite good damage and is fairly self sustained enabling you to kill your add quickly. Swap to staff for the last few percent and be ready to <Skill name="Empower"/> in the middle. This works better the slower the group is due to weapon swap cooldown. If another person helps you kill your add (typically the <Specialization name="Renegade"/>) you can chill on staff for the add so you are ready to swap to Axe/Torch sooner.
- **Enso**: Be on staff at the beginning of every phase and use <Skill name="Empower"/> while Ensolyss is invulnerable.
- **Skorvald**: Anomalies 2 and 4. In case your group gets too fast you might have to skip <Skill name="Empower"/> at the 2nd island. When using the 66% portal make sure to drop a <Skill name="Symbol of Swiftness"/> on Skorvald before swapping to Axe/Torch.
- **Artsariiv**: If your party deals the majority of its damage in the middle you want to empower at 66% and 33% shortly before she becomes vulnerable. If not you may empower while she is jumping away and the team kills the Anomaly.
- **Arkk**: Finish your orb first by camping in the light field and auto attacking with the superior weapon (staff) so you can precast <Skill name="Empower"/> and <Skill name="Symbol of Swiftness"/>.
- **Ai**: On light Ai you will want to <Skill name="Empower"/> mid at the beginning of the fight and after each split phase. You should also swap to Staff during the split mechanic so you can cast <Skill name="Empower"/> as everyone returns to the middle. On Dark Ai this is mostly the same aside from the lack of split phases so keep an eye on <Boon name="might"/> and be ready to swap to Staff when needed. Remember with the amount of movement on this fight to be casting <Skill name="Symbol of Swiftness"/> where possible to help keep everyone moving.

Tomes are very useful when no other skills are ready. <Skill name="Tome of Justice"/> also gets refreshed every time an enemy dies (works with anomalies at Artsariiv/Arkk, knights at MAMA and hallucinations at Siax).

<Skill name="Tome of Courage"/> and <Skill name="Tome of Resolve"/> are great for high incoming damage scenarios.

- <Skill name="Tome of Resolve"/> (F2):
  - Skill 2 is a party condition cleanse
  - Skill 3 grants <Boon name="Vigor"/>, <Boon name="Regeneration"/> and <Boon name="Swiftness"/>
  - Skill 4 is a good party heal
  - Skill 5 increases healing on allies for 8s by 33% and converts up to 5 conditions to boons
- <Skill name="Tome of Courage"/> (F3):
  - Skill 1 grants <Boon name="Stability"/> and <Boon name="Swiftness"/>
  - Skill 3 is a 5s reflect
  - Skill 4 grants <Boon name="Resistance"/> and breaks stun
  - Skill 5 grants <Boon name="Aegis"/>, <Boon name="Protection"/>, <Boon name="Stability"/> and 300 toughness for 5 seconds
