<Warning>  

This build is made for PuGs environments. More info about building effective team compositions can be found [here](/guides/teamcomp101/). It provides a high amount of boons and a lot of safety to the group via its healing and therefore shines most in less experienced groups as well as when you have bad instabilities. Once the safety of a dedicated healer is no longer needed, you can move on to running e.g. [Power Boon Chronomancer](/builds/mesmer/power-chronomancer/) and other alternative boon providing build options.    
   
</Warning>         
 

The <Specialization name="Chronomancer" text="Heal Boon Chronomancer"/> is able to provide permanently up to  25 stacks of <Boon name="Might"/>, either <Boon name="Quickness"/> or <Boon name="Alacrity"/>, <Boon name="Fury"/>, <Boon name="Protection"/>, <Boon name="Regeneration"/>, <Boon name="Vigor"/> and a majority of the required <Boon name="Swiftness"/> uptime. It also has on-demand access to <Boon name="Aegis" />, <Boon name="Stability"/> and <Boon name="Resistance"/>. The build is very flexible and can be adapted to the encounter, instabilities, and the group you are playing with. Make sure to read through the situational tab for an explanation of the different utility skills. 

It offers a great amount of healing through Clone related traits like <Trait name="Illusionary Inspiration"/>, <Trait name="Restorative Illusions"/>, Wells via <Trait name="All's Well That Ends Well"/>, <Boon name="Regeneration"/>, <Trait name="Restorative Mantras"/>. As well as providing boon removal in order to deal with <Instability name="No Pain, No Gain"/>. It also has great utility for T4 fractals, with pulls through <Skill name="Temporal Curtain"/>, and access to <Effect name="Stealth"/>, <Effect name="Superspeed"/>, and leaps such as <Skill name="Mirage Thrust"/> for skips.

Note that this build variant is optimized for 150 agony resistance and providing yourself with permanent <Boon name="Regeneration"/> in order to achieve 100% boon duration (utilising the additional 250  concentration of <Trait name="Chaotic Persistence"/>). 

<Item id="99965"/> adds some <Effect name="Barrier"/> to the toolkit and has great synergy with <Skill name="Mantra of Recovery"/> and the corresponding traits. Alternatively if you feel like your party needs more healing take <Item id="100031"/>. 

If you want to use one gear setup for other types of instanced content we reccomend using the [Raid/Strike](https://snowcrows.com/builds/mesmer/chronomancer/heal-boon-chronomancer) setup, due to not having the extra attributes from <Item id="79722" text="Fractal Potions"/> outside of Fractals. 

Check the Skill Explanations section below for alternative weapon setups. When boonstrip is required it is recommended to swap <Item id="74326"/> for <Item id="72872"/>.

#### Traits for Skips
While we don't recommend leaving your party during boss fights, when dealing with sections of trash mobs, <Specialization name="Mesmer"/> has fantastic utility to speed these sections up, often allowing your party to ignore sectrions of some fractals entirely, using Blinks, <Effect name="Stealth"/>, and <Effect name="Superspeed"/>. Some traits you will find useful for this are:
- <Trait name="Temporal Enchanter"/> - This will let you provide <Effect name="Superspeed"/> to yourself and your party.
- <Trait name="Prismatic Understanding"/> - This will increase the duration of <Effect name="Stealth"/> gained from skills such as <Skill name="Mass Invisibility"/> and <Skill name="Veil"/>.
- Utilize Mirage for skips when moving across large distances or you need leaps! <Trait name="Elusive Mind"/>, <Skill name="Jaunt"/> and <Skill name="Mirage Thrust"/> along with the typical Mesmer toolset makes it really good for mobility and skips.

### Scepter / Shield
- <Skill name="Ether Bolt"/> (Scepter 1): Is the start of your Scepter auto attack chain. While this does not directly heal, the final attack in the chain, <Skill name="Ether Clone"/> will generate a Clone.
- <Skill name="Illusionary Counter"/> (Scepter 2): A channeled skill that will block an attack and generate two clones (if a block is triggered). Alternatively the channel can be canceled by double tapping the skill to cast <Skill name="Counterspell"/> create one Clone regardless.

### Generating Clones
To play <Specialization text="Heal Boon Chronomancer" name="Chronomancer"/> you'll want to be constantly generating clones.

Clone generation gets covered by a number of skill. On Scepter, the third hit of your Scepter attack chain <Skill name="Ether Clone"/> and double casting of <Skill name="Illusionary Counter"/> (Scepter 2) will both generate one clone each. Casting <Skill name="Illusionary Counter"/> (Scepter 2) and blocking an attack will generate 2 clones. On Staff, <Skill name="Phase Retreat"/> (Staff 2) will also generate a clone, however it also will teleport you back, away from the party.  Using a healing skill will generate a clone through <Trait name="Ego Restoration"/>.

Additionally, illusions summoned from <Skill name="Phantasmal Warlock"/> (Staff 3) and <Skill name="Echo of Memory"/> (Shield 4) will turn into clones after finishing their attacks. Therefore you want to be using these skills to generate illusions and clones as often as possible to try and maintain three clones and generate them as quickly as possible after using Shatter skills. 

Outside of Phantasms, <Skill name="Well of Action"/> grants up to a third of your <Boon name="Might"/> application and <Boon name="Fury"/> id used off cooldown (be careful since the boons are applied after a three second delay). <Skill name="Tides of Time"/> can be aligned with defiance breaks, but remember to use it in your rotation, to help maintain <Boon name="Might"/> and <Boon name="Swiftness"/>. <Skill name="Mantra of Pain"/> can also be taken to help maintain <Boon name="Might"/> if you find it dropping.

### Shatters
Clones can then be used to improve the effects of Shatters, to trigger:
- <Trait name="Seize the Moment"/> to provide <Boon name="Quickness"/>, or <Trait name="Stretched Time"/> (which makes <Trait name="Flow of Time"/> affect allies) to provide <Boon name="Alacrity"/>
- <Trait name="Illusionary Defense"/> for <Boon name="Protection"/>
- <Trait name="Bountiful Disillusionment"/> which generates <Boon name="Stability"/>, <Boon name="Might"/>, <Boon name="Fury"/>, and <Boon name="Vigor"/>
- <Trait name="Illusionary Membrane"/> amd <Trait name="Chaotic Transference"/> which generate <Boon name="Regeneration"/>, <Boon name="Swiftness"/>, and <Boon name="Protection"/>

<Skill name="Split Second"/> and <Skill name="Rewinder"/> should be used off cooldown, 
ideally with 3 active Clones.

The same can be applied to <Skill name="Time Sink"/>, although it should be saved for CC if you are due a defiance bar.

<Skill name="Distortion"/> should be held for emergency <Boon name="Stability"/>/<Boon name="Aegis"/>.

### Continuum Split
Entering <Skill name="Continuum Split"/> gives you a free cast of any of your availible skills. When it ends you will be reverted back to the position where you entered with your skill cooldowns also reverted. The duration of <Skill name="Continuum Split"/> depends on the amount of Clones spent.

If the last stack of one of your Mantras gets used during the Continuum Split, the skill will not be reverted and need to be channeled again!

Use **all** Shatters while in <Skill name="Continuum Split"/> for additional boons.

<Skill name="Continuum Split"/> gets the most value at boon precasts, and during combat, if you either need additional CC, <Boon name="Stability"/>/<Boon name="Aegis"/>, or burst heal.

<Divider text="Situational Boons"/>
<Grid>
<GridItem sm="6">

### Stability
- Correct application of <Boon name="Stability"/> requires knowledge of the encounters and which attacks and be negated with <Boon name="Stability"/> without taking too much damage.
- <Skill name="Mantra of Concentration"/> is your main tool and grants 4 stacks of <Boon name="Stability"/> after the initial channel and 3 stacks of <Boon name="Stability"/> for each of the two remaining casts. If a phase requires <Boon name="Stability"/> right at the start, it makes sense to precast the channeled version e.g. Arkk.
- <Skill name="Distortion"/> share 3 stacks of <Boon name="Stability"/> through <Trait name="Bountiful Disillusionment"/> and should be used as a backup source, while at least one instance of <Skill name="Mantra of Concentration"/> is recharging.
- Any Shatter with <Trait name="Bountiful Disillusionment"/> will grant you 1 stack of personal <Boon name="Stability"/>

### Aegis

- Correct application of <Boon name="Aegis"/> requires knowledge of the encounters and which attacks are impactful to block.

- <Skill name="Well of Precognition"/> provides one stack of <Boon name="Aegis"/> at the initial cast and on every follow up pulse. Your best choice for multiple incomming hits at a short period of time e.g. some MAMA patterns and Siaxs Volatile Hallucinations.

- <Skill name="Distortion"/> immediately grants one stack of <Boon name="Aegis"/> via <Trait name="Inspiring Distortion"/>. A great emergency skill.

- <Skill name="Signet of Inspiration"/> (or any other Signet) grants one stack of <Boon name="Aegis"/> via <Trait name="Inspiring Distortion"/>, when <Trait name="Blurred Inscriptions"/> is traited. Play this instead of <Skill name="Well of Precognition"/>.   

### Resistance

- Correct application of <Boon name="Resistance"/> requires knowledge of the encounters and which conditions can be temporarely negated by <Boon name="Resistance"/>. E.g. at some T4 fractals <Condition name="Immobile"/> can be ignored to activate multiple trigger points, as well as at encounters that bombard your group with <Condition name="Slow"/> and <Condition name="Chilled"/>.
- Any Glamour skill shares <Boon name="Resistance"/> through <Trait name="Temporal Enchanter"/>. Most of the time <Skill name="Feedback"/> is the preffered skill to do this.
- <Trait name="Mental Defense"/> shares <Boon name="Resistance"/> when <Skill name="Distortion"/> is used, at the cost of some healing and condition cleanse. In power compositions this can become crucial at Arstariiv, dealing with <Condition name="Weakness"/> applied. Since an optimised precast can fully cover the entire first phase.

### Sustained Healing
Every summoning of Illusions heals allies within a 360 radius.

Granting the standard boons as described above, already covers most of your sustained heal. 

Cast <Skill name="Mantra of Recovery"/> whenever it gets back up to 2 charges, to make use of the 
<Boon name="Regeneration"/> provided by <Trait name="Metaphysical Rejuvenation"/>.

<Trait name="Restorative Mantras"/> and <Trait name="All's Well That Ends Well"/> adds up to that, as most of your utility skill choices are going to fall into that category.

### Burst Heal & Condition Cleanse
After you initially ramped up your boons, try to safe up on Clones, to shatter these, in case of foreseeable damage threats.

If you got the opportunity to swap to Staff, <Skill name="Phantasmal Warlock"/> is gonna count as creating 4 Illusions for additional healing, especially when playing with <Item id="44947"/>.   

<Trait name="Illusionary Inspiration"/> can provide decent burst heal, if you manage your ressources wisely and the same applies to condition pressure, combined with <Skill name="Mantra of Resolve"/> or <Trait name="Sympathetic Visage"/>.

The remaining charges of <Skill name="Mantra of Recovery"/> can help due to <Trait name="Mender's Purity"/> and <Trait name="Restorative Illusions"/>.

If you want to add more condition cleanse, consider playing <Skill name="Well of Eternity"/> and <Item id="100390"/>.
