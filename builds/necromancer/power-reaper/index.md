The <Specialization name="Reaper" text="Power Reaper"/> is one of the best picks for players wanting to be more independent of their party. Due to large amounts of self-produced <Condition name="Vulnerability"/>, <Boon name="Quickness"/> and <Boon name="Might"/> it is good in parties where your teammates do not perform very well.

The <Specialization name="Reaper" text="Power Reaper" /> has multiple offensive skill
options (<Control name="Pull" />, boon corruptions for <Instability name="No Pain, No Gain" />
, <Condition name="Blinded" />, <Condition name="Immobile" />, etc.) <Specialization
  name="Reaper"
  text="Power Reaper"
/> can modify itself to fit many given situations in fractals.

It benefits from slaying potions such as <Item id="50082"/> and <Item name="Impact" type="Sigil"/>.

Something Something this build is better in pugs and stuff, situationally on some fights the <Item id="24836"/> setup can be better.

If you want to optimise this build with infusions you can run 14 <Item name="Mighty +9 Agony Infusion"/> and 4 <Item name="Precise +9 Agony Infusion"/>, with a <Item id="48081" text="Berserkers Helm"/>.
