The <Specialization name="Scourge" text="Celestial Scourge"/> is an easy build to learn and provides excellent support in the form of barrier, might, vulnerability and crowd control.
The build can reliably make use of <Item name="Absorption" type="Sigil"/> to manage boons from <Instability name="No Pain, No Gain"/>	and has access to many different utilities to pick and choose depending on what your party may need. For example, <Skill name="Trail of Anguish"/> gives you access to a personal stunbreak, group <Boon name="Stability"/>, <Boon name="Swiftness"/>, applies <Condition name="Burning"/> and being a [Punishment type skill](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Punishment) corrupts one boon from enemy targets.

<Skill name="Serpent Siphon"/> will grant <Boon name="Regeneration"/>, <Boon name="Aegis"/>, barrier and <Boon name="Alacrity"/>.

If you need more boon strip for <Instability name="No Pain, No Gain"/> or <Instability name="Vengeance"/>, replace <Item name="Torment" type="Sigil"/> for <Item name="Absorption" type="Sigil"/>, <Skill name="Vile Blast"/>, <Skill name="Oppressive Collapse"/>, <Skill name="Garish Pillar"/> and any other hard CC skill you slot will trigger it.

Only swap to <Item affix="Celestial" type="Warhorn"/> if you need the CC from <Skill name="Wail of Doom"/> or <Boon name="Swiftness"/> from <Skill name="Locust Swarm"/>.
### Shade Skills

In order to utilize shade-skills you either place a shade onto your target or stay within 180 range yourself.

- Maintain at least 1 shade at all times.
- Using your shade skills will add additional applications of <Condition name="Torment"/> and <Condition name="Vulnerability"/> (from <Trait name="Unyielding Blast"/>). 
- The standard setup will allow you to spam all shade skills on cooldown.
- <Skill name="Nefarious Favor"/> will convert one condition on allies to a boon.
- <Skill name="Sand Cascade"/> will grant allies barrier, 2 stacks of <Boon name="Might"/> and <Boon name="Alacrity"/> from <Trait name="Abrasive Grit"/> and <Trait name="Desert Empowerment"/>.
- <Skill name="Garish Pillar"/> will apply 2 seconds of <Condition name="Fear"/>, heal, teleport to you and partially revive downed allies through <Trait name="Transfusion"/>.
- <Skill name="Sandstorm Shroud"/> will pulse 4 times barrier, 2 stacks of <Boon name="Might"/>, <Boon name="Protection"/>, <Boon name="Alacrity"/> and heal allies through <Trait name="Abrasive Grit"/>, <Trait name="Herald of Sorrow"/>, <Trait name="Desert Empowerment"/> and <Trait name="Life from Death"/>
- <Skill name="Manifest Sand Shade"/> can be used to target the Anomalies in the [Shattered Observatory](/fractals/shattered-observatory) fractal or Sorrows in the [Sunqua Peak](fractals/sunqua-peak) fractal. A <Specialization name="Scourge"/> counts as a shade activator itself and will also hit any targets within the range of your shade abilities.
- Additionally shade effects do not stack, they only expand the area in which they get applied.



<Divider text="Rotation"/>

<Grid>
<GridItem sm="6">
This build does not have an actual rotation or a skill priority, most of your skills will be used on cooldown unless you need to delay them to deal with mechanics, your shade skills are instant casts and your utilities are going to be changed and used whenever necessary.
### Opener

1. <Skill name="Manifest Sand Shade"/> (ideally precasted)
2. <Skill name="Vile Blast"/> + <Skill name="Sandstorm Shroud"/>
3. <Skill name="Weeping Shots"/> + <Skill name="Nefarious Favor"/> + <Skill name="Sand Cascade"/>
4. <Skill name="Harrowing Wave"/>
5. <Skill name="Oppressive Collapse"/>



</GridItem>
<GridItem sm="6">
