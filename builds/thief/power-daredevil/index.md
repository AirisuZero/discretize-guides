<Warning>
<Specialization name="Daredevil" text="Power Daredevil"/> is an incredibly strong build to play in T4 fractals and is a great build to swap to if you play <BuildLink build="Condi Specter" specialization="Specter"/> in CMs. In T4s recognising when to swap between <Specialization name="Daredevil" text="Power Daredevil"/> and <Specialization name="Specter" text="Condi Specter"/> will be a massive gain to your team and well worth the extra effort, making thief a very rewarding class to play!
</Warning>

The <Specialization name="Daredevil" text="Power Daredevil"/> has great sustained DPS, great burst on stacked trash mobs, good single target burst, brings excellent crowd control and offers <Effect name="Stealth"/>, which paired with top tier mobility thanks to <Skill id="13025"/>, <Skill id="13002"/> and <Skill id="13064"/> can enable fast skips in T4s. <Specialization name="Daredevil"/> has a very simplistic rotation, which makes it fairly easy to play, but due to initiative and energy management, <Specialization name="Daredevil"/> becomes quite hard to master.

In fractals <Specialization name="Daredevil" text="Power Daredevil"/> does have some drawbacks:

1. First reason is <Trait id="1268"/>, which forces <Specialization name="Daredevil"/> to constantly flank to crit cap, unless you adjust your gear (with the current setup this isn't required if you run <Skill name="Signet of Agility"/>).
2. While being a very strong build on a lot of T4s, <Specialization name="Daredevil" text="Power Daredevil"/> struggles to keep up with other power builds on CMs and it is reccomended to play <BuildLink build="Condi Specter" specialization="Specter"/> instead.
3. Because of <Trait id="2047"/>, you may be pushing your teammates on fractals with <Instability name="Social Awkwardness"/> instability into deadly zones.

The build benefits from slaying potions such as <Item id="50082"/> and <Item name="Impact" type="Sigil"/>.

<Card title="Tips">

Staff 5 <Skill id="30597"/> is worth using if you can hit 4 or more mobs at once. Especially since staff autoattacks and <Skill id="29911"/> can only hit 3 targets. So on big groups of trash mobs you should just spam <Skill id="30597"/> and then finish them with <Skill id="13085"/>.

Another amazing shortbow skill is <Skill id="13041"/> (Shortbow 2). It is a blast finisher with a low initiative cost. Use it to blast <Boon name="Might"/> and <Effect name="Stealth"/> with fire and smoke fields respectively.

Keep in mind you can precast skills like <Skill id="13037"/>, <Skill id="13082"/> or <Skill id="13132"/> and take the mistlock singularity to refresh their coolddown. For example: Precast <Skill id="13082"/>, take mistlock, cast <Skill id="13132"/>, and swap to <Skill id="13082"/> again.

Although <Specialization name="Daredevil"/> doesn't have access to <Effect name="Superspeed"/> by default. You can use a template with <Item id="88118"/>, <Item id="85244"/> or <Item id="49940"/> can be used to execute even more skips for your party in T4s.
