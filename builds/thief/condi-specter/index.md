<Warning>

This build guide is not complete, gear and sections may chage regularly as we explore the new elite spec and spend more time playing it in fractals!

</Warning>

<Warning>

This build is [META](/guides/meta-explained) in condi comps. In terms of DPS, it is unlikely to fall behind any other specialization, whether they be running a power or condi build, as it has very high sustained DPS on single targets.

> A condi build will always have a tendency to interfere with a power composition, as it is not meant to have a higher upfront or burst damage, but both of these builds will do a lot of burst damage as well. It is worth mentioning that _Venom Skills_ are very strong in that regard, and precasting them on the _Mistlock Singularity_ will allow for a very high burst, quite uncommon for condi builds but very valuable.

</Warning>

The **<Specialization text="Condi Specter" name="Specter"/>** is a high DPS condition build with great team support options. tThe value of this build comes from the pure damage that it will bring, which is inflated by the **<Specialization text="Condi Soulbeast" name="Soulbeast"/>**'s <Skill id="40498"/>, on top of Venom Skills which can be precast on the _Mistlock Singularity_, and casted again as soon as your allies have consumed them by attacking the target. At the same time it can generate barrier, heal and provide boons by targeting allied players.

If healing isn't an issue, this is the perfect build to use <Item name="writofmasterfulmalice"/> over <Item name="tuningicicle"/> ! <Skill name="signetofmalice"/> is also the strongest personal-healing ability you can bring to maintain your health over 90%, if you feel you don't need <Skill name="hideinshadows"/>.

The <Skill name="skelkvenom"/> is a much better option to support your party as it brings a tremendous amount of party heal.
It's recommended to run a shortbow for additional movement during downtime and <Boon name="might"/> blasts on the _Mistlock Singularity_. You will also want a Pistol with <Item id="24639"/> to help CC during Artsariiv splits.

Watching videos of players performing the rotation for this build, one might think that it is easy to play; after all, the **<Specialization text="Thief" name="Thief"/>** tends to have spammy rotations, for the same reason mentioned before. The _Initiative_ system allows for multiple, redundant casts of the same ability, during the entire duration of the fight. It is easy to see that one ability will always perform better than other ones, based on the ratio of damage dealt over _Initiative_ points spent. Here are a the main reasons as to why this rotation isn't actually as easy as it looks, as well as some tips to master the rotation, depending on the encounter.

<Card title="Precasting">

All Damaging Venom Skills should be casted on the _Mistlock Singularity_: <Skill name="Skale Venom"/>, <Skill name="Spider Venom"/> and <Skill name="Devourer Venom"/>. On stationary bosses which can be manually activated, instead of precasting <Skill name="Devourer Venom"/>, you can instead go to the spawn location and precast <Skill name="preparethousandneedles"/>. All you have to do then is to activate the Preparation when the boss becomes vulnerable, and cast it again as it will be off cooldown. This is possible on Skorvald, Artsariiv, Arkk, MAMA and Ensolyss with the use of a <Item name="White Mantle Portal Device"/>, or on Siax without. It is also possible on the Sorrowful Spellcaster (Light & Dark Ai), but with a 1/4 chance of success.

- On 100CM, make sure to precast venoms on your <Skill id="13082"/> minions, as every boon and special ability effect currently on you will be stripped upon starting the encounter.
- Spam <Skill name="clusterbomb"/> for <Boon name="might"/> blasts on the _Mistlock Singularity_.
