<Warning>

This build is strong in full condi groups ([team comps](/guides/effective-comp)). In power groups this build will fall massively behind <Specialization name="Soulbeast" text="Power Soulbeast"/> - the power damage counterpart.
</Warning>

Condi <Specialization name="Soulbeast"/> is a DPS build with high sustained damage and reasonable burst that also provides strong party buffs with <Skill name="Sun Spirit"/> and <Skill name="One Wolf Pack"/>, and crowd control (CC) skills. This build is mostly used for 100CM, for most other fractals, especially if your group are playing power builds, you will be better off playing the power variant found [here](/builds/ranger/power-soulbeast/).

This build is rather self sufficient due to:

- Boon extension by <Trait name="Essence of speed"/>, <Skill name="We heal as one"/>
- Good CC with <Skill id="46432"/> and <Skill name="Concussion Shot"/>
- High mobility via <Skill name="Instinctive Engage"/> and <Skill name="Quick Shot"/>

Overall this is a very well rounded build that is rewarding to play in both PuGs and organized teams alike.

<Beginner>

This guide will focus on the Shortbow + Dagger/Torch variant of the build with <Trait name="Light on your Feet"/> which is the most used version in fractals. There are some alternatives for specific situations with slightly varying rotations. Once you are able to exceute the step-by-step rotation provided below without spending too much thought on it and are confident with the utility options provided here, head over and check out the advanced page for some extra information. Feel free to swap to the advanced page early if you feel like you are missing some information on additional (less common) utility skills, trait swaps or other weapon variants.

This builds damage depends on the amount of <Specialization name="Soulbeast" text="Condi Soulbeasts"/> in the party. The build deals similar DPS with 2 <Specialization name="Soulbeast" text="Condi Soulbeasts"/>, and outperforms the Krait build if you have 3 <Specialization name="Soulbeast" text="Condi Soulbeasts"/> in the party. If you are going to be on your own run the Krait rune setup!

This build uses the Jade Bot Core: Tier 10 in combination with 14 <Item name="Spiteful +9 Agony Infusion"/> to cap Bleeding duration. If you do not have the Jade Core, run all 18 <Item name="Spiteful +9 Agony Infusion"/>.

<Card title="Information">

When playing <Specialization name="Soulbeast" text="Condi Soulbeast"/> in 100CM, <Trait name="Light on your Feet"/> is much more attractive choice than <Trait name="Quickdraw"/> which is used in raids. The reason being that Ai moves around far too much for you to be able to benefit from using skills like <Skill name="Bonfire"/> twice in most cases. Also with some strategic dodging during movement and downtime you can keep a very high <Trait name="Light on your Feet"/> uptime especially during your bursts which leads to very high DPS.

The rotation in general is very simple, just keep rotating between your Shortbow and Dagger/Torch set using your utility skills as often as you can. When you get to the point of auto attacking use your <Skill id="42944"/> skills to fill.

<Card title="Precasting">

When precasting in fractals we want to stack as many useful boons with as much duration as possible, these being <Boon name="Might"/>, <Boon name="Fury"/>, <Boon name="Quickness"/>, <Boon name="Alacrity"/> and <Boon name="Swiftness"/>. We can also cast useful unique effects, for a <Specialization name="Soulbeast" text="Condi Soulbeast"/> this means your stances such as <Skill name="Vulture Stance"/>, <Skill name="Moa Stance"/> and <Skill name="One Wolf Pack"/>.

As a <Specialization name="Soulbeast" text="Condi Soulbeast"/> there are also multiple skills and traits that can be quickly prestacked for extra condis and damage at the start of fights. These aren't necessary to do and depending on the encounter not all are possible, but if you have the time and can make use of them they are worth to use.

### **Stances**

As a <Specialization name="Soulbeast" text="Condi Soulbeast"/> we have three important stances to share with <Trait name="Leader of the Pack"/> when precasting.

**<Skill name="Moa Stance"/> -** This will increase your party members boon duration by 66%, which when added to the conversion from <Item id="74185"/> means your party will have close to 100% boon duration without even swapping gear. This means any boons your party stacks duration will be close to doubled.

**<Skill name="Vulture Stance"/> -** This will help your party stack some initial condis and some initial <Boon name="Might"/> at the start of the fight and should be the last thing you cast before taking the _Mistlock Singularity_.

### **Boons**

**<Boon name="Might"/> -** Before starting fights we want to have 25 stacks of <Boon name="Might"/>, the standard way of this in fractals is from blasting a fire field. If no one else in your party will provide one you can use <Skill name="Bonfire"/> on torch. in the fire field we want to use blast finishers which each one will give 3 stacks of <Boon name="Might"/> for 20 seconds (not accounting for boon duration). Our main blast is from <Skill name="Call of the Wild"/> which can be used twice and also gives 6 stacks of might for 10 seconds along with the blast (again not accounting for boon duration).

**<Boon name="Fury"/> and <Boon name="Swiftness"/> -** We can provide these boons again by using <Skill name="Call of the Wild"/>. These boons stack up to 30 seconds, so by blasting twice with Warhorn and under the effect of <Skill name="Moa Stance"/>, we can provide the maximum duration for our party.

### **Traits**

**<Trait name="Poison Master"/> -** If you can get into combat before precasting you can use <Skill id="40588"/> (Merged F3) to proc <Trait name="Poison Master"/> for some extra <Condition name="poisoned" text ="Poison"/> stacks on your opener

**<Trait name="Light on your Feet"/> -** Stacks in duration by dodging and using <Skill name="Quick Shot"/>. This will increase you condi duration which means if you are playing with <Item id="24687"/> means your <Condition name="Poisoned"/> duration will be capped. It will also increase your strike damage (power) for a bit of extra damage.

### **Skills**

**<Skill name="Sharpening Stone"/> -** Used for some additional <Condition name="Bleeding"/> at the start of the fight. If you use a second time while you still have charges left, the original charges will be overwritten.

**<Skill name="Sharpen Spines"/> -** Can be precasted by merging with Bristleback for extra bleeding at the start of the fight. This stacks in intensity so you can use the skill after taking the mistlock giving you 10 stacks of <Condition name="Bleeding"/>.

**<Skill name="Crippling Shot"/> -** Can be precasted giving you the effect _Blood Thirst_ lasting for 11 seconds. When you have this effect and are merged your next 3 attacks will inflict 1 stack of <Condition name="Bleeding"/> lasting for 12 seconds.

**<Skill name="Double Arc"/> -** Can be precasted giving you the effect _Poisonous Strike_ lasting for 7 seconds. When you have this effect and are merged your next 2 attacks will inflict 1 stack of <Condition name="poisoned" text ="Poison"/> lasting for 6 seconds. This skill can be used twice giving you 3 charges.

<Card title="Step-by-Step Rotation">

**Step 1: Weapon Rotation**

The highest priority skills are your weapon skills, namely skill 2,4 and 5 on both sets. The weapon skill rotation will be the backbone of your rotation and you will not want to interrupt it for any other skill. Any further steps will introduce more skills to fill the gaps between your weapon skills, so it is a good idea to spend some time practising this step.

The weapon rotation is:
1. Start on Shortbow and use <Skill name="Poison Volley"/>, <Skill name="Crippling Shot"/> and <Skill name="Concussion Shot"/>.
2. Swap to Dagger/Torch and use <Skill name="Double Arc"/>, <Skill name="Throw Torch"/> and <Skill name="Bonfire"/>.
3. Keep using these skills off-cooldown. Your 3rd <Skill name="Double Arc"/> and 2nd <Skill name="Throw Torch"/> should come back at the same time. Use them and swap back to Shortbow.
4. Use <Skill name="Poison Volley"/>, <Skill name="Crippling Shot"/> and <Skill name="Concussion Shot"/> off-cooldown (with this priority) until you used <Skill name="Poison Volley"/> 3 times.
5. Repeat from step 2.

**Step 2: Beastmode Skills**

Your <Skill name="Beastmode"/> skills will fill some gaps in your weapon rotation. Use them off-cooldown but do not interrupt or delay yoru weapon rotation for them. The priority depends on the Pet you are using.

For Lynx, the priority is:
1. <Skill id="44514"/>
2. <Skill id="40588"/>

For Warthog, the priority is:
1. <Skill id="46432"/>
2. <Skill id="41406"/>
3. <Skill id="40588"/>
 
Keep in mind that <Skill id="46432"/> is also a CC skill, so delay it for breakbars if necessary but try not to delay it for too long if possible.


**Step 3: Utility Skills**

Next up, we want to incorporate our Utility Skills. These will generally also be used off-cooldown with a higher priority than the <Skill name="Beastmode"/> skills.

- When running with <Skill name="Sun Spirit"/>, make sure to keep in on the group as best as possible. If you know the boss will not move within the next 15 seconds, you can use <Skill name="Solar Flare"/> as an extra filler skill to inflict some <Condition name="Burning"/>.
- <Skill name="One Wolf Pack"/> is your highest priority utility skill. Use it off-cooldown but don't waste it in split phases. Make sure everyone is in your range and can attack the boss when you cast it.
- When running <Skill name="Vipers Nest"/>, use it off-cooldown but make sure to not use it right before the boss moves.
- <Skill name="Sharpening Stone"/> and <Skill name="Vulture Stance"/> are instant-cast so you can use them off-cooldown, even while casting other skills. Make sure to be in range of your allies when using <Skill name="Vulture Stance"/>.

**Step 4: Easy Precasts**

Lastly, we will look at some easy precasts you can (almost) always do with low effort but good reward:

1. <Skill name="Double Arc"/>, <Skill name="Crippling Shot"/> and <Skill name="Sharpening Stone"/> all provide a boost to your next attacks after being used. You can use these before the fight if you do not get into combat by doing so (no other enemies around). This becomes even more efficient if a Mistlock Singularity is present to reset the skill cooldowns.
2. If a Mistlock Singularity is present, you can cast your Stances as well, namely <Skill name="One Wolf Pack"/> and <Skill name="Vulture Stance"/>.

<Card title="Improving Further">
Once you are comfortable with the above steps, you are basically doing the full rotation and will be able to deal great damage.

There will be a few additional things on the advanced page to improve further but if you got to here, you already know the most important things and these will have less total impact than what you learned so far.

Most of the additional steps will be extra precasts to have a higher damage spike or help with providing boons for your party at the Mistlock Singularity.
