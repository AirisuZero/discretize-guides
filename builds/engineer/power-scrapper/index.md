<Divider text="Gameplay"/>

<Specialization name="Scrapper" text="Power Scrapper"/> Has a priority based rotation, that . Besides that it tries to ensure high uptime on several modifiers to increase its damage:
- <Item name="Relic of Fireworks"/> is gained for 6 seconds after hitting a weapon skill with 20+ seconds cooldown. See the list below.
- <Trait name="Object in Motion"/> is gained for 10 seconds after using any hard CC skill. See the defiance bar damage table above.
- <Trait name="Modified Ammunition"/> is active while you are above 90% health.
- <Trait name="Explosive Temper"/> is active while you are above 90% health.

You want to **always** be in <Skill name="Beastmode"/> when dealing damage. A lot of attributes and modifiers are tied to it. Besides manually using <Skill name="Leave Beastmode"/>, you will get kicked out of <Skill name="Beastmode"/> when your [Rigorous Certainty](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Rigorous_Certainty) (cheat death) granted by a *Mistlock Singularity* activates.

For your <Skill name="Sic Em"/> burst make sure you are in <Skill name="Beastmode"/> and if possible have all of the 3 modifiers mentioned above. On top of that it is beneficial to align the burst with moments where the target takes increased damage, for example when <Effect name="Exposed"/> or <Control name="Stun"/> are present on the target. <Control name="Stun"/> increases your damage dealt when playing with <Item id="24868"/>. Your Skills will also deal slightly more damage when hitting on a weapon set with Axe or Sword due to <Trait name="Honed Axes"/> and <Trait name="Striders Strength"/>.

Several of your skills may interrupt the previous skill cast or can be interrupted by most other skills. Timing these casts correctly is of interest for good <Specialization name="Soulbeast" text="Power Soulbeast"/> gameplay. See the lists of interrupts and channels below. Since it is an instant cast skill, <Skill name="Sic Em"/> can be used during the cast of other skills.

#### Extra Notes
- <Trait name="Essence of Speed"/> in combination with <Trait name="Live Fast"/> means that using <Skill name="Worldly Impact"/> extends your boons. The healing skill <Skill name="We Heal As One"/> allows you to gain a copy of each boon on yourself while in <Skill name="Beastmode"/>. Both of these can help maintain boons on yourself.
- <Skill name="Quickening Zephyr"/> and <Skill name="Signet of the hunt"/> in combination with the <Item id="85244"/> allows you to move extremely fast and is useful for a few skips. Check the [Fractal Guides](/fractals) for specific skips. Superspeed will also override the speed decrease when carrying treasure in [Siren's Reef](/fractals/sirens-reef).

<Divider text="Rotation / Skill Usage"/>
<Warning>

Golem rotations from Raids are generally suboptimal in Fractals due to being optimized for sustained DPS. In Fractals players need to adapt their rotation to the amount of time a group needs to finish a phase or specific burst windows like <Effect name="Exposed"/>.
