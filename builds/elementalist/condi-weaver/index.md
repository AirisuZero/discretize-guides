The **<Specialization text="Condi Weaver" name="Weaver"/>** is an unique build that can be played very effectively in [Sunqua Peak](/fractals/sunqua-peak) and Silent Surf CMs, and will almost always outperform <BuildLink build="Power Weaver" specialization="Weaver"/> (if you find yourself in a slow group, this build can also be an attractive choice for ''slower'' encounters like Ensolyss).

Condi <Specialization name="Weaver"/> can deal very high amounts of damage, and even rival strong builds like <BuildLink build="Condi Soulbeast" specialization="Soulbeast"/> and <BuildLink build="Condi Scourge" specialization="Scourge"/> when played properly.

This build is naturally tanky due to its rotation, having above 90% uptime on the <Skill name="Rocky Loop"/> buff. On top of that damage reduction, it has permanent 10% DR from <Trait name="Geomancer's Training"/> and 7% DR on ~ 40% uptime from <Trait name="Stone Flesh"/>. 

The main downside of **<Specialization text="Condi Weaver" name="Weaver"/>** apart from the complexity of its rotation is the lack of unique party buffs and overall boon generation, apart from some <Boon name="Might"/> generated by <Skill id="25486"/>.

<Card title="Disclaimer">

Golem rotations out of the raid builds are generally suboptimal in fractals due to <Effect name="Exposed"/> and phases being much shorter compared to raids. The raid rotations are optimized for sustained DPS while in fractals a player needs the ability to adapt a rotation to the amount of time a group needs to finish a phase.

<Card title="Precasting">

### **Precast in non boonstrip fights** 
If you know you can only get one <Skill name="Weave Self"/> during the fight then you can precast it and use the second one later. To do that you have to: 

- Start on <Skill name="Fire Attunement"/>/<Skill name="Earth Attunement"/> and precast <Skill name="Glyph of ELemental Power"/>, replace a utility with <Skill name="Arcane Power"/> and precast it
- Attune to <Skill name="Earth Attunement"/>/<Skill name="Fire Attunement"/> and precast <Skill name="Weave Self"/>.
- Switch back your replaced utility
- Take the _Mistlock Singularity_ and attune to <Skill name="Earth Attunement"/>/<Skill name="Earth Attunement"/> for <Trait name="Elements of Rage"/>
- Attune to <Skill name="Air Attunement"/>/<Skill name="Earth Attunement"/> and start the fight.

### **Precast in fights with boonstrip** 
In [Sunqua Peak](/fractals/sunqua-peak) and Silent Surf CMs boons and some specific buffs get stripped the moment you enter combat so your precast has to be adjusted. Also these fights favor use of <Skill name="Glyph of Lesser Elementals"/>

- Start on <Skill name="Fire Attunement"/>, precast <Skill name="Glyph of Lesser Elementals"/> replace your other utilities with <Skill name="Glyph of ELemental Power"/>, <Skill name="Arcane Power"/> and precast them
- Take the _Mistlock Singularity_ and cast another <Skill name="Glyph of Lesser Elementals"/>
- Attune to <Skill name="Earth Attunement"/>/<Skill name="Fire Attunement"/> and switch back to your normal utilities
- Attune to <Skill name="Earth Attunement"/>/<Skill name="Earth Attunement"/> for <Trait name="Elements of Rage"/>
- Attune to <Skill name="Air Attunement"/>/<Skill name="Earth Attunement"/> and start the fight

### **Extra Precast for [Sunqua Peak](/fractals/sunqua-peak) and Silent Surf CMs**

If you have an extra set of weapons (or legendary sigils), you can also precast the effects of <Item name="Doom"/> and <Item name="Leeching"/>. To do that:

- Switch to the sigils 
- For Sunqua Peak fall below the stairs before the boss' arena to get in combat and switch to any attunement.
- For Silent Surf let go of the parachute a bit earlier so as you get in combat when you fall down and switch to any attunement. 
- Once you are out of combat, you can switch the sigils back to <Item name="Earth"/> and <Item name="Geomancy"/>.

<Card title="Important Notes">

- <Skill name="Signet of Fire"/> is one of your most important DPS skills. Use it off cooldown!

- Make sure to always use <Skill name="Glyph of ELemental Power"/> in <Skill name="Fire Attunement"/>. If the boss is about to phase or die, your next best option is to use it in <Skill name="Earth Attunement"/>. If you find yourself is any other element, you should use it regardless, as it grants increased strike damage on your next few attacks.

- <Skill name="Primordial Stance"/> should be used before attuning to <Skill name="Earth Attunement" disableText/> <Skill name="Fire Attunement" disableText/> for maximum damage output. However, if the boss' breakbar is about to be broken or about to phase, you can also use it during <Skill name="Fire Attunement" disableText/> <Skill name="Earth Attunement" disableText/> or <Skill name="Fire Attunement" disableText/> <Skill name="Fire Attunement" disableText/>.

- Although it is important to follow the weave self rotation as closer as possible, the timing when it comes to completing it, is extremely tight and you might find yourself unable to do it especially if you don't have boons precasted on you and they have to be applied once you get in combat. In that scenario the best adjustment you can do is slightly altering the ending. Instead of doing the <Skill name="Fire Attunement" disableText/>/<Skill name="Fire Attunement" disableText/> => <Skill name="Earth Attunement" disableText/>/<Skill name="Fire Attunement" disableText/> => <Skill name="Water Attunement" disableText/>/<Skill name="Earth Attunement" disableText/> loop, do this one: <Skill name="Fire Attunement" disableText/>/<Skill name="Fire Attunement" disableText/> => <Skill name="Water Attunement" disableText/><Skill name="Fire Attunement" disableText/>, use <Skill name="Triple Sear"/> and activate <Skill id="69184"/> there, attune to <Skill name="Earth Attunement" disableText/>/<Skill name="Water Attunement" disableText/>, use <Skill name="Whirling Stones"/>, activate <Skill id="69413"/>, move to <Skill name="Fire Attunement" disableText/>/<Skill name="Earth Attunement" disableText/> and continue with the main loop. 

- In the video, a 2nd <Skill name="Weave Self"/> rotation is shown, which is the same as the 1st. If the encounter has downtime due to phases in between when the boss can't be damaged and <Skill name="Weave Self"/> comes off cd then you can freely attune to air and start from the opener. If it doesn't and you know the boss is going to phase before you need to finish the weave self loop, then you can use <Skill name="Weave Self"/> right away the moment it comes off cd in the attunement you are in and only switch between <Skill name="Fire Attunement" disableText/> and <Skill name="Earth Attunement" disableText/> without entering <Skill name="Tailored Victory"/>. If you get <Skill name="Weave Self"/> off cd mid fight and the phase is long enough that you need to complete it then it is recommended to attune to <Skill name="Air Attunement" disableText/> and start from there because completing weave self otherwise is going to be a lot more awkward.
