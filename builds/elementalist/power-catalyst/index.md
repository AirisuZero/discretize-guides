The <Specialization name="Catalyst" text="Power Catalyst"/> is a strong DPS build for fractals. <Specialization name="Catalyst" text="Power Catalyst"/> provides conjures and <Condition name="Vulnerability"/>, as well as some <Boon name="Might"/> and <Boon name="Protection"/> through _Spheres_ and potentially blasting fire fields and extending boons with <Skill name="Sand Squall"/>. It may also swap traits and gear to provide permanent <Boon name="Quickness"/> and a decent amount of extra <Boon name="Might"/>. It is also very useful for some T4 skips in fractals like Aetherblade, Cliffside, Thaumanova Reactor etc. thanks to high mobility and <Skill id="5536"/>.

This build has a bit less burst than <Specialization text="Power Weaver" name="Weaver"/> but offers extra utility through the boons of the Jade Spheres.

This build unlike <Specialization text="Power Weaver" name="Weaver"/> has higher survivalbility due to 20% extra stats from <Trait name="Elemental Empowerment"/>. Some defensive utilities are available in <Skill name="Water Attunement"/> and <Skill name="Earth Attunement"/> but you will be using them during your normal rotation and not always be in the correct attunement when you need the defense. .

This build has one of the harder rotations in the game but is very enjoyable to play - if given some dedication. The build benefits heavily from slaying potions and sigils such as <Item id="50082"/> and <Item name="Serpent Slaying" type="Sigil"/>.

### Jade Spheres

As a Catalyst, your unique class mechanic is the energy system and your Jade Sphere.

- You build up energy by attacking your enemy up to a maximum of 30.
- Your F5 skill will cost 10 energy and cast a Jade Sphere based on your current attunement, for example <Skill id="63458"/>.
- Your Jade Spheres damage enemies and provide boons to allies while they are active. They also act as combo fields.
- This means, that even on the full DPS build you will provide some boons to help out the group.

Certain traits interact with your sphere, namely:

- <Trait name="Spectacular Sphere"/> makes your Sphere grant an extra boon based on the attunement. At the same time it allows you to provide <Boon name="Quickness"/> with every sphere.

- <Trait name="Sphere Specialist"/> doubles the duration of the boons applied, making it possible to provide higher boon uptime when traited with <Trait name="Spectacular Sphere"/>.

### Weapon Skills

Sword/Warhorn is a very straightforward set, you want to use every high damaging skill and fill with auto attacks in between.

- Learning the icons of each attack in the auto attack chain can be helpful to make sure that you always complete it. In air and fire the final auto looks like an upwards facing sword <Skill name="Searing Slash"/> <Skill name="calllightning" profession="elementalist" />
- <Skill name="Wildfire"/>, <Skill name="Lightning Orb"/> and <Skill name="Dust Storm"/> proc the fireworks buff and in air <Skill name="Cyclone"/> also does.
- <Skill name="Polaric Leap"/>, <Skill name="Flame Uprising"/> and <Skill name="Earthen Vortex"/> are combo finishers and the main contribution for <Trait name="Elemental Empowerment"/> stacks

Some of your weapon skills bring nice extra utility, like:

- <Skill name="Earthen vortex"/> acts as a dodge.
- <Skill name="Water Globe"/> heals and provides a water field.
- <Skill name="Tidal Surge"/> heals and provides <Boon name="Regeneration"/>.
- <Skill name="Sand Squall"/> extends boons and also acts as a blast. 

This can sometimes be quite handy, however, all these skills are either used in the rotation or locked behind specific attunements so you will usually not want to delay anything by a lot to use them.

### Utility Skills

As a Catalyst, you gain access to augments. You will be using two of them by default, namely <Skill name="Relentless Fire"/> and <Skill name="Shattering Ice"/>. Other augments listed in the situational skills section can also be useful.

Augments grant you a buff and gain a bonus effect when cast near their corresponding sphere. This is usually either a duration increase for the buff or a cooldown decrease for the skill.

For example, <Skill name="Relentless Fire"/> will grant you a damage increase for 5 seconds. This is increased by 3 additional seconds when cast near a <Skill id="63458"/>. Therefore, you usually want to use them in the corresponding attunement.

### Elite Skills

Conjures are specific to the Elementalist class.

- Casting a Conjure skill will give the weapon to you as a bundle replacing your weapon skills and leave one copy on the ground for yourself or an ally to pick up.
- In fractals, you will mostly use these to precast additional damage at the start of the fight and between phases. Some Conjures will be used only for CC.

The most common Conjure you will be runnning most of the time is <Skill name="Conjure Fiery Greatsword"/> (FGS).

- <Skill name="Firestorm"/> is the most used skill on this weapon. It deals constant damage in the targeted area and can therefore be precasted before the fight or between phases for extra burst.
- If you pick up the FGS in the middle of your rotation, <Skill name="Fiery Rush"/> usually offers more damage than auto-attacking on your regular weapon set. It also rushes you to the enemy and is therefore great for mobility.
- <Skill name="Fiery Whirl"/> is also great for mobility to get back from your split add during Siax. 

<Skill name="Elemental Celerity"/> can replace fgs on some bosses with equal or better results. More specifically: 
- If you can use it twice during the fight (but fgs only once) or if you can cast <Skill name="Firestorm"/> only once in total, then it is worth replacing <Skill name="Conjure Fiery Greatsword"/> (Skorvald, Arkk. Ensolyss)
- In cases where you can get <Skill name="Elemental Celerity"/> twice but also 2x 
<Skill name="Firestorm"/> they can be considered equal. (Artsariiv)
- And in cases where you can get 2x <Skill name="Firestorm"/> but only 1 <Skill name="Elemental Celerity"/>, <Skill name="Conjure Fiery Greatsword"/> is better (MAMA, Siax)

Notes:
- The above examples are taking into account a relatively fast group, the slower your group is the more adjustments you need to consider making
- If you play with <Skill name="Elemental Celerity"/> then <Skill name="Conjure Fiery Greatsword"/> can always be precasted before you take the mistlock

### Trait Interactions

<Trait name="Empowering Auras"/> is a buff unique to Catalyst. It grants a 2% outgoing damage buff capping at 5 stacks.

Traits that interact with Elemental Empowerment stacks are:

- <Trait name="Empowering Auras"/> gives you a stack whenever you gain an aura.
- <Trait name="Elemental Epitome"/> provides you an aura every time you combo. Actively helping to blast <Boon name="Might"/> at the Singularity is therefore even more beneficial, even if you just do it for your DPS.

<Trait name="Elemental Empowerment"/> is a buff unique to Catalyst. It grants a 1% bonus to all stats capping at 10 stacks.

Traits that interact with Elemental Empowerment stacks are:

- <Trait name="Vicious Empowerment"/> gives 2 stacks whenever you disable a foe.
- <Trait name="Elemental Empowerment"/> gives 3 stacks while in combat.
- <Trait name="Elemental Epitome"/> gives 1 stack every time you gain an aura and grants an aura when doing a combo.
- <Trait name="Empowered Empowerment"/> doubles the effectiveness at 10 stacks and grants 50% effectiveness at <10 stacks (DPS build only).

<Divider text="Rotation / Skill usage"/>

<Information>
Golem rotations out of the raid builds are generally suboptimal in fractals due to <Effect name="Exposed"/> and phases being much shorter compared to raids. The raid rotations are optimized for sustained DPS while in fractals a player needs the ability to adapt a rotation to the amount of time a group needs to finish a phase.

### Step-by-Step Rotation

This is a step-by-step explanation of the Catalyst rotation. A mostly complete written rotation and some extra info can be found in step 3. The steps do not indicate what skills do the most damage, it merely demonstrates a possible way to learn the rotation. Keep in mind that this rotation is performed on a standard average golem, on bosses with shorter phases and/or downtime in between although the general idea will be the same, there might be adjustments you need to make

**Step 1: Attunement Order, Auto Attack Chains and Damaging Skills**

In the first step, we will take a look at weapon skills.

1. Start in <Skill name="Air Attunement"/> and cast <Skill name="Polaric Leap"/>, <Skill name="Lightning Orb"/>, <Skill name="Quantum Strike"/>, <Skill name="Cyclone"/>
2. Swap to <Skill name="Fire Attunement"/> and cast <Skill name="Flame Uprising"/>, <Skill name="Wildfire"/>, <Skill name="Cauterizing Strike"/>
3. Perform 3x Auto Attack Chains until <Skill name="Flame Uprising"/> is ready again to be used
4. Swap to <Skill name="Earth Attunement"/> and cast <Skill name="Earthen Vortex"/>, <Skill name="Dust Storm"/>, <Skill name="Rust Frenzy"/>
5. Swap back to <Skill name="Air Attunement"/> and perform 3x Auto Attack Chains
6. Repeat from step 1 

This will give you a basic idea of what skills are important, how their cooldowns line up and how the auto attack chain functions

**Step 2: Jade Sphere and Utilities**

Now it is time to take a look at the Jade Sphere and Utilities, namely <Skill name="Relentless Fire"/>, <Skill name="Arcane Blast"/> and <Skill name="Glyph of Storms"/>. Augments become stronger when cast near the corresponding Sphere. We will have enough energy to cast our Jade Sphere in Air, Fire, and Earth. Use the Augment right after casting the corresponding Sphere.Use Arcane Blast in Fire because that is where you have the highest damaging modifiers on you. Keep in mind that spheres are instant cast actions so they can be used immediately when you swap attunements as long as you have the energy needed. 

1. Start in <Skill name="Air Attunement"/>, precast <Skill name="Lightning Storm"/>, cast <Skill id="62940"/> and cast <Skill name="Polaric Leap"/>, <Skill name="Lightning Orb"/>, <Skill name="Quantum Strike"/>, <Skill name="Cyclone"/>
2. Swap to <Skill name="Fire Attunement"/>, <Skill id="63396"/>, followed by <Skill name="Relentless Fire"/> and cast <Skill name="Flame Uprising"/>, <Skill name="Wildfire"/>, <Skill name="Cauterizing Strike"/> the Auto Attack x3 until <Skill name="Flame Uprising"/> is off cd
3. Swap to <Skill name="Earth Attunement"/>, cast <Skill id="62837"/> and cast <Skill name="Earthen Vortex"/>, <Skill name="Dust Storm"/>, <Skill name="Rust Frenzy"/>
5. Swap back to <Skill name="Air Attunement"/> and Auto Attack x3
6. Repeat step 1 (without glyph of storms since it will be on cooldown)

Try to use spheres back to back when possible (for example from air to fire) because that way you minimize the 5 seconds internal cooldown that exists until you can start generating energy again.

**Step 3: Elite skill, 2x flame uprising, firestorm and wildfire off cd**

Glyph of storms gives you 4 different options depending on your attunement and the ones you want to be using are firestorm and lightning storm. Lightning storm is the strongest option but with a high cooldown so if you know you won't be able to use lightning storm in every phase or again in the entire fight, you can fit a firestorm somewhere in between and end with a lightning storm.
If you have the catalyst elite skill slotted it can be used to either reset air skills or fire skills. 
The rotation will look like this:

1. Start in <Skill name="Air Attunement"/>, precast <Skill name="Lightning Storm"/>, cast <Skill id="62940"/> and cast <Skill name="Polaric Leap"/>, <Skill name="Lightning Orb"/>, <Skill name="Quantum Strike"/>, <Skill name="Cyclone"/>
2. Swap to <Skill name="Fire Attunement"/>, <Skill id="63396"/>, followed by <Skill name="Relentless Fire"/> and  <Skill name="Arcane Blast"/>, <Skill name="Wldfire"/>, <Skill name="Cauterizing Strike"/>, <Skill name="Flame Uprising"/>, <Skill name="Elemental Celerity"/>, <Skill name="Wldfire"/>, <Skill name="Cauterizing Strike"/>, <Skill name="Flame Uprising"/>
3. Swap to <Skill name="Earth Attunement"/> and cast <Skill name="Earthen Vortex"/>, <Skill name="Dust Storm"/>, <Skill name="Rust Frenzy"/>
5. Swap back to <Skill name="Air Attunement"/> and Auto Attack x3
6. Repeat step 1 (without glyph of storms and elemental celerity since they will be on cooldown)

**Step 4: Water Attunement, Skill quequing and Cancelling aftercasts**

After learning what skills to press and in what order the last thing is to learn how to queque them and how to cancel some aftercasts. Skill quequing means that you can always click the next skill you want to press as long it can't interrupt your previous one (air and earth 2 can do that for example) so as the action happens immediately when the previous animation is done. You can also use a skill while you are switching attunements which is done with flame uprising, cyclone, and rust frenzy. 

Aftercasts are animations that keep happening even after all the damage a skill can do has been applied to the target. They can be avoided by interrupting them with another skill. For example rust frenzy has a long aftercast that can be interrupted with polaric leap. 

In fractals, you will mostly use Conjures to precast skills at the start of the fight or between phases. The most important skills are <Skill name="Invoke Lightning"/> from <Skill name="Conjure Lightning Hammer"/> as well as <Skill name="Firestorm"/> from <Skill name="Conjure Fiery Greatsword"/>.

<Card title="Precasting">

If a _Mistlock Singularity_ is present, you should precast your personal buffs and/or boons for better personal performance. Not precasting in fractals is gonna severly hurt your damage since the buff <Trait name="Empowering Auras"/> adds 10% to your damage and takes a while to build up which means the boss will have phased before you have 5 stacks. 

To deal with that issue the easiest precast you can do before interacting with _Mistlock Singularity_ is by having a staff in your other set start in <Skill name="Water Attunement"/> and use <Skill name="Ice Spike"/>, <Skill name="Frozen Ground"/>, <Skill name="Magnetic Aura"/>, <Skill name="Transmute Earth"/>. This grants you the maximum amount of stacks right away, then you should also refresh them with <Skill name="Sand Squall"/> and extent boons for you and your allies. 

Note: <Skill name="Frozen Ground"/> is an ice field and it can interfere with the general group precast which relies on a fire field for might. If you want to do this kind of precast then simply place your field a bit outside of the group while still being in range to receive their boons. An ice field is neccessary because it is the only field which gives 2 auras and thus 2 stacks once you blast it. 

But if you don't want to go that way, as an elementalist, you also have easy access to fire fields and blasts providing <Boon name="Might"/> as well as <Trait name="Empowering Auras"/> stacks. In that scenario you only need a scepter in your other set, you can start in fire and do the following sequence: 

1. Start in <Skill name="Fire Attunement"/> and cast <Skill name="Wildfire"/> to provide a fire field. Alternatively, use an off-hand Dagger to provide a fire field with <Skill name="Ring of Fire"/>.
2. Blast it using <Skill name="Phoenix"/>.
3. Use <Skill name="Dargon's Tooth"/> while switching to water
4. Wait for the combo to finish in water and swap to air
5. Blast using <Skill name="Arcane Brilliance"/>
6. Precast <Skill name="Relentless Fire"/> and <Skill name="Shattering Ice"/>. You can also precast <Skill id="5635"/> and then swap back to your regular utility skills.
7. Cast <Skill id="5516"/>.
8. Take the _Mistlock Singularity_.

It is recommended to use separate precast templates to cast different utility and weapon skills.
Just make sure that both templates use the same traits to not get the status to reset on swap.

### Extra Info

- One possible way of adapting your rotation to your phase timing is skipping auto-attacks in <Skill name="Earth Attunement"/> to get to your big damaging skills in <Skill name="Air Attunement"/> like <Skill name="Grand Finale"/> faster if the phase is about to end.
- Try to move away from your target early if you know it will go <Effect name="Invulnerability"/> like MAMA. Hitting an <Effect name="Invulnerability"/> target with your Hammer 3 orbs will make them disappear which can confuse your rotation as you will not be able to cast <Skill name="Grand Finale"/> unless the orb corresponding to the attunement you are in is active. You will also lose important damage buffs this way. You can reset your rotation from this happening by using <Skill name="Grand Finale"/> in <Skill name="Earth Attunement"/> if you notice it early enough so you can start over by activating <Skill name="Crescent Wind"/> in <Skill name="Air Attunement"/>.
