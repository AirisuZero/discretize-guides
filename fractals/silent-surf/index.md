## Documentation

Join forces with Captain Thess and his intrepid Serpent Clan crew to unearth the survivors of the Jade Wind's devastating aftermath. As you navigate through the haunting expanse of the petrified sea, an unforeseen peril emerges from the depthsâ€”an encroaching evil that hungers for power. Dive headfirst into the Silent Surf's caverns, and together with Captain Thess, you will unveil the sinister force that lurks beneath the petrified sea's surface. For those who seek an even greater challenge, you can test your skills in the challenge mode. Here, you will face a more brutal version of the final fight. The path below is treacherous; the stakes are monumental. Will you pierce the shroud of growing evil and find the survivors?
