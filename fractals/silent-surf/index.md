Join forces with Captain Thess and his intrepid Serpent Clan crew to unearth the survivors of the Jade Wind's devastating aftermath. As you navigate through the haunting expanse of the petrified sea, an unforeseen peril emerges from the depthsâ€”an encroaching evil that hungers for power. Dive headfirst into the Silent Surf's caverns, and together with Captain Thess, you will unveil the sinister force that lurks beneath the petrified sea's surface. For those who seek an even greater challenge, you can test your skills in the challenge mode. Here, you will face a more brutal version of the final fight. The path below is treacherous; the stakes are monumental. Will you pierce the shroud of growing evil and find the survivors?

## Spelunking

Insert something about the kit, link the skills (might need to add them to discretizeui if they arent in the gw2 api).

On entering the fractal you will meet Captain Thess. Near to Thess is a box of leftover supplies. Interacting with this will give you access to a bundle using your special action key, giving you access to the followng skills:
- <Skill name="Grappling Hook"/> (Skill 1)
- <Skill name="Parachute"/> (Skill 2)
- <Skill name="Black Powder Charge"/> (Skill 3)
- <Skill name="Flare"/> (SKill 5)

You will need to use these skills to progress through the cave, however, be careful since these skills are ammunition based. As you progress through the fractal you will encounter more leftover supplies to replenish ammunition. As you move through each section, Thress will open up portals behind you to allow you to return to previous areas, or any slower party members to skip forward and catch up. Additionally, if you fall, you will be ported to the last checkpoint by Thess for another attempt. Also by using <Skill name="Grappling Hook"/> (Skill 1), or <Skill name="Parachute"/> (Skill 2), or landing directly on a bouncing mushroom, you will negate any fall damage when landing on platforms.

<Information>
There are multiple ways to progress through the "jumping puzzle" section of this fractal. It is not necessary to follow the skill usage below, especially if going for the Peace and Quiet achievement!
</Information>

<Grid>
<GridItem sm="6">

### First Drop

Interacting with the first box of leftover supplies will provide you with a <Skill name="Parachute" text="1 Parachute"/>. When you are ready jump into the hole and use <Skill name="Parachute"/> (skill 2) to safely land at the bottom, triggering the first checkpoint.

</GridItem>

### Zipline

At the bottom you will find a second box giving you <Skill name="Grappling Hook" text="1 Grappling Hook"/> amd <Skill name="Parachute" text="1 Parachute"/>. Use the <Skill name="Grappling Hook"/> (skill 1) to grapple to the platform in front of you and take the zipline to the platform below. Take the next zipline, which will dismount you at the end and send you falling towards the ground. Use <Skill name="Parachute"/> (skill 2) to break your fall. 

When ready stand in the white circle (you need at least two playsers in this circle for the fractal to continue). With enough players in the circle, a short event will spawn requiring you to fend off an attack from some bats and spiders. Fending off the attack will trigger the second checkpoint and Thess will open a portal that can be used to travel back through the fractal.

</GridItem>

<GridItem sm="6">
### Bouncing Mushrooms

The third box of leftover supplies will give you <Skill name="Grappling Hook" text="1 Grappling Hook"/>, <Skill name="Parachute" text="1 Parachute"/>, and <Skill name="Black Powder Charge" text="1 Black Powder Charge"/>. Looking over the edge of the platform you will see some large bouncing mushrooms below.

Jump down onto the mushrooms (as long as you hit them you will not take fall damage) and as you get flung into the air use <Skill name="Grappling Hook"/> (skill 1) on the  large Stalactite in the center of the cavern. If required, you can then use <Skill name="Black Powder Charge"/> (skill 3) to boost yourself forward to land on the ground infront of you. Use the Wind Cannon to get boosted up to the next platform.

Like the last section, you need at least two players to stand in the white circle on the platform to progress the fractal. This starts the event clear out the Naga raiders. Once dealt with the third checkpoint will trigger and Thess will open up another portal.

### Wind Cannons

On the platform is another box of leftover supplies. This box gives you <Skill name="Grappling Hook" text="3 Grappling Hooks"/>, <Skill name="Parachute" text="2 Parachutes"/>, and <Skill name="Black Powder Charge" text="1 Black Powder Charge"/>. When ready enter the next Wind Cannon, which weill shoot you onto a zupline above. At the end of the zipline you will be dismounted and fall towards more bouncing mushrooms (if you need, use a <Skill name="Grappling Hook"/> (Skill 1) or <Skill name="Parachute"/> (Skill 2) charge to adjust your course). The mushrooms will send you into another Wind Cannon leaving you on another ledge.

In the distance below, you will see some bouncing mushrooms, make your way over to them using the bundle skills you have available. These bouncing mushrooms will send you into another Wind Cannon, onto a zipline, which will again dismount you at the end, sending you falling to the ground below. Use a <Skill name="Grappling Hook"/> (Skill 1) or <Skill name="Parachute"/> (Skill 2) charge to survive the landing.

Once again, have two players stand in the white circle to progress the fractal triggering the final checkpoint. Thess will arive and open a final portal and the "Survive the corrupted ambushers" event begins. Once the ambush has been survived, you will remain in combat until you have fought Corrupted First Mate Dolus. 

</GridItem>
</Grid>

## Corrupted First Mate Dolus

Corrupted First Mate Dolus is a simple fight that has two main mechanics. When Dolus appears he is untargatable while he does his first attack, Dread Visage. A large eye will appear above his head, when you see this turn your character model to face away to avoid getting <Condition name="Fear" text="Feared"/>. Thess will be knocked off the platform and the fight will begin.

Dolus will now be targetable and start casting Frightening Speed (the numbers attack). Each player will be marked with a number and get an expanding AoE around them. Spread out making sure to not stand in another players circle and after a short period Dolus will dash to each player in ascending order attacking them.  Dolus has a small defiance bar, which when broken will <Control name="Stun"/> him, cancelling his current attack and in higher dps groups, allow you to stack and ignore the numbers mechanic, killing Dolus before he has a chance to cast anything else.

Once you have finished the fight, take the _Mistlock Singularity_ to reset your cooldowns, interact with the box of leftover supplies which will give you <Skill name="Parachute" text="1 Parachute"/> and jump off the edge to find the final boss platform. If you need to go back through the fractal for any reason, before jumping feel fee to take the portal which will take you back to previous checkpoints.

Similar to Sunqua Peak, at the start you interact with the Challenge Mote to spawn a portal, which will take you directly to the platform where you fight First Mate Dolus. After triggering the circle, a couple of Naga will spawn and then, after a couple of lines from Captain Thess, Dolus will spawn similar to Normal Mode. 

Do not take mistlock before triggering the circle! This way you can kill Dolus quickly and reset your cooldowns before fighting Kanaxai.
